<p class="h2sub">THE WOLF AT THE DOOR.</p>

<p>“I’ve been robbed!” gasped Mrs. Hazard, a pleasant-featured
little woman of perhaps forty, sinking into a chair,
her face the picture of dismay.</p>

<p>“Mother,” exclaimed her daughter Annie, a slender, delicate
girl of fifteen, who sat in a cane rocker, feather-stitching
an infant’s jacket with blue silk, a small pile of the
unfinished garments lying in a box on a table before her,
“what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“The rent money is gone. I had it in this corner of the
bureau, waiting for the agent, whom I expect at any moment.
There were two fives and five ones. They are not here now.
Where could they have gone?”</p>

<p>“The money may have slipped under some article in the
drawer, mother,” suggested the girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No; I have searched and turned over everything. The
money is gone. How are we to face this fresh misfortune?”</p>

<p>Mother and daughter looked at one another in silent discouragement.</p>

<p>And well they might feel discouraged since, with the
exception of perhaps fifty cents in silver, the missing
money had represented their entire capital.</p>

<p>And Jack, the other member of the family, a particularly
bright and ambitious boy of sixteen years, had just lost his
position, owing to the failure of the firm with whom he
had been employed ever since the death of the husband and
father, two years before, had thrown them upon their own
resources.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of Mr. Hazard the family had lived
in a rented house on a side street in a very respectable neighborhood
uptown and had been considered well off.</p>

<p>Jack and Annie had graduated from the public school
and were expecting to enter the high school with the next
term, when their father died suddenly, and it was found
that Mr. Hazard, who had been a liberal provider, had
lived up to his means and, what was more unfortunate, had
neglected to insure his life.</p>

<p>Of course, Mrs. Hazard had to move to a cheaper home
and neighborhood, for the few dollars she found herself
possessed of after the funeral and other necessary expenses
had been paid would not keep them for any great length of
time.</p>

<p>Jack soon found a position with a wholesale house down
town, at five dollars a week.</p>

<p>Annie, who was naturally quite expert at fine needlework
and embroidery, preferred to take in work to do at home
to seeking a place in a factory or in a store as a salesgirl,
because she was not very strong.</p>

<p>But home work was not very remunerative, so that the
family really was dependent upon Jack, who fortunately
was strong and healthy.</p>

<p>Thus they managed to live&mdash;exist might perhaps be the
better word&mdash;in a very humble but contented way until the
boy was unexpectedly thrown out of work a few days before.</p>

<p>Fortunately Mrs. Hazard had got her rent together, for
the first of the month was at hand and the landlord’s agent
was a strict man of business and showed no favors to any
of the tenants.</p>

<p>And now at the very last minute, as if to prove that misfortune
never comes singly, the money she had saved by
many small sacrifices was suddenly found to be missing.</p>

<p>It certainly was hard luck.</p>

<p>“Somebody must have taken it, mother,” said Annie,
after a short silence.</p>

<p>“The bills were there this morning after John went out,
for I noticed them,” said the little mother, sadly.</p>

<p>“And I’ve been in here all the time except a few minutes
when I ran out to the grocer’s. Was anyone here while I
was out?”</p>

<p>“Only Maggie McFadden.”</p>

<p>Miss McFadden lived in the flat across the hall.</p>

<p>“You don’t think she could have taken the money, do
you, mother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to think that she did,” replied Mrs. Hazard,
mournfully.</p>

<p>“Maggie lost her position two weeks ago because there
was some trouble about her accounts,” said Annie, slowly,
as though an unpleasant suspicion was forcing itself in her
mind.</p>

<p>The McFadden girl, who was somewhat airy and pert in
her manners, was conspicuous in the neighborhood for the
number and variety of her gowns and hats, and the gossips
wondered where she got the money to pay for them all.</p>

<p>When approached on the subject she invariably said that
Denny, her brother, made “slathers of dough on the races,”
thereby intimating that that was the source which produced
much of her finery; but many of her acquaintances knew
Denny better than she had any idea of, and these persons
rather doubted Miss Maggie’s statement.</p>

<p>At any rate, when she lost her position as cashier of a
large packing house, the neighbors winked their eyes one
at another and whispered, “I told you so.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hazard was at no loss to understand what her daughter
meant, and the sigh she uttered spoke her own thoughts
as plainly as words.</p>

<p>“We never could accuse her,” continued Annie, dejectedly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hazard shook her head.</p>

<p>“Poor Jack! What will he say when we tell him?” said
Annie. “It will be such a shock to him. He is so hopeful.
He told me only this morning that as long as we had next
month’s rent in hand the future didn’t worry him. He’d
see we got along somehow. Isn’t he just the best and dearest
brother in the world?”</p>

<p>“I dread the agent’s visit, for he will surely be here to-day.
He is always so prompt. What shall I say to him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, mother.”</p>

<p>The crisis was too much for them, and mother and daughter
wept silently together.</p>

<p>At that moment there came a sharp rap on the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hazard started, hastily wiped her eyes, and with a
nervous glance at her daughter, answered the summons.</p>

<p>Mr. Grab, the agent for the premises, walked brusquely
into the room.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, madam. I presume you have been expecting
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Mrs. Hazard, faintly.</p>

<p>“I never like to disappoint my tenants,” said the agent
grimly. “Here is your receipt, I suppose you have the
money ready.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, sir, I will have to ask you to wait a few
days,” said Mrs. Hazard, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you the money, madam?” spoke the agent
rather roughly.</p>

<p>“I did have it in my bureau drawer, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But what?” demanded Mr. Grab, sharply.</p>

<p>“It is gone,” said the little woman, with tears stealing
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Gone!” ejaculated the agent, lifting his shaggy brows,
“Where?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grab rubbed his chin, on which had sprouted a three
days’ growth of bristly reddish hair, and a threatening look
came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Madam, this is a very lame excuse,” he said, angrily.</p>

<p>“It is the truth, sir.”</p>

<p>“You can’t pay, then?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; but if you will wait&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait, madam! I expect my tenants to pay up promptly.
My experience is that if one can’t pay on the first one can’t
pay on the second or third, and that if you trust a tenant
once he always tries to take advantage of your good nature.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, I have never failed to have the money ready
before, and we have lived here more than a year.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, madam; and in consideration of that fact
I will on this occasion allow three days’ grace. I will call
at twelve o’clock on Friday, and if you are not ready to
pay then, I will have to serve you with dispossess proceedings.
Good day, madam.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grab thereupon took his departure, leaving his distressed
tenants in a sad state of perplexity as to where the
needed fifteen dollars would come from in so short a space
of time.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">IN WHICH JACK HAZARD MAKES A HERO OF HIMSELF.</p>

<p>When Jack Hazard left his home that morning, after
kissing his mother and sister, as was his invariable custom,
he was in good spirits.</p>

<p>“I’ll get something to do to-day sure,” he said to himself.
“Mother has the rent, thank goodness, and I haven’t that
on my mind.”</p>

<p>He found his particular friend, Ed Potter, waiting for
him at the corner.</p>

<p>Ed worked in a Vandewater Street printing house, and
he and Jack always walked down town from the neighborhood
of Grand Street together of a morning.</p>

<p>“Haven’t caught on yet, have you, Jack?” inquired
Potter.</p>

<p>“No; but I’ve a dozen places here I’ve cut out of the
‘World’ that I’m going to look up.”</p>

<p>“Hope you’ll connect with one. If you knew anything
about typesticking I could put you on to a job. There’s
a shop on Nassau Street wants a boy to pull proofs, hold
copy, and fill in at the case on plain reprint. If you were
only up in the business you could get seven or eight dollars
a week.”</p>

<p>“I should like to earn as much as that,” said Jack,
eagerly, “but I guess I’ll have to be satisfied with less to
start with.”</p>

<p>“Why, one of these jobs is in Brooklyn,” said Ed. “You
aren’t going over there after work, are you?”</p>

<p>“Sure, if I fail to get it on this side of the bridge,”
replied Jack, with a determined air.</p>

<p>“But it’ll cost you carfare every day.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t; I mean to walk over the bridge.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to leave the house earlier.”</p>

<p>“I guess I will, and get home later; but when a fellow
is looking for work, things don’t always come his way.
However, I mean to try for all my New York ads first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that Brooklyn place will be gone long before you
cover all these other jobs. It won’t be worth while bothering
about it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not letting anything get by me.”</p>

<p>Which showed that Jack Hazard was a persevering boy:
and perseverance is one of the greatest factors of success
through life.</p>

<p>The two boys parted at the entrance to the freight elevator
of the Vandewater Street printing house, and Jack
turned into Frankfort Street, crossed over to William, and
began his daily hustle for work.</p>

<p>At many places he found a crowd already collected before
he arrived, and after waiting a short time failed to secure
an interview, as some boy ahead of him got the job.</p>

<p>One place the man wanted him to work every Saturday
till ten at night, and offered him the munificent sum of
$3.50 per week, with a prospective raise of fifty cents at
the end of six months.</p>

<p>Jack refused this, as he believed he could do much better,
and besides he really could not afford to work for so small
a sum.</p>

<p>At another place he found he would have to work on
Sunday every other week, and, this being against his principles,
he moved on.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ll have to strike that Brooklyn place, after
all,” he said as he stepped out of a Water Street ship
chandlery that had advertised for a bright boy and had
taken a youth on trial an hour before.</p>

<p>A fleet of canal-boats was banked up against the wharves
opposite, and Jack felt a strong temptation to hang around
a little while and watch them take aboard and discharge
their cargoes.</p>

<p>But, realizing that this wasn’t business, he turned away
and hurried up the street.</p>

<p>“I might as well cross by Fulton Ferry,” he mused; “it’ll
save time, and time is money with me just now.”</p>

<p>Although the three cents made a hole in the dime he
had brought with him to pay for his lunch, Jack received
his change with his customary cheerfulness and walked on
board the boat.</p>

<p>It was half-past nine, and the boy noticed that quite a
number of passengers were on board as the boat pulled out
from the dock and headed across the river.</p>

<p>He leaned on the rail alongside a fine-looking old gentleman
who held a little girl of five years by the hand while
he pointed out various landmarks along the receding shore
to a stylishly-dressed lady who looked enough like him to
be his daughter.</p>

<p>“Gran’pa! gran’pa!” cried the child, tugging at the gentleman’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” he answered, smiling down on her.</p>

<p>“Lift me up, p’ease; I want to see, too.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman raised the little girl and seated her
on the rail while he held her about the waist.</p>

<p>She looked up and down the sun-kissed river in great
delight.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it b’utiful, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p>Then she noticed Jack’s admiring gaze.</p>

<p>He thought she was the most charming little creature he
had ever seen.</p>

<p>She smiled in a friendly way, and then with some little
hesitation held out one of her hands to him.</p>

<p>He took it and shook it gently.</p>

<p>“Oo is a nice boy, ain’t oo?”</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked at Jack, and the lady smiled,
while the boy himself flushed a little at the child’s artless
remark and the attention it had drawn to him.</p>

<p>“Oo! Isn’t dat high!” cried the girl, pointing at the
central span of the Brooklyn bridge.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>Just then the engine bell rang, and the boat stopped in
mid-stream, while her whistle gave out several shrill toots.</p>

<p>Another gong sounded, and the boat began to back and
her head to swerve slowly down the river.</p>

<p>Jack looked ahead as well as he could and saw part of
a large freight float close aboard.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden and violent shock that threw the
passengers almost off their feet.</p>

<p>The boy grabbed the rail, but the old gentleman went
down on the deck, his arm slipping from the child, who
went overboard with the shock.</p>

<p>The lady, who had been thrown back several feet, gave
a heart-rending scream and flew at the rail.</p>

<p>“Fanny, my darling! Oh, heaven, she is overboard! Save
her!”</p>

<p>The little girl had struggled for a moment on the surface
of the river and then sank out of sight.</p>

<p>One or two men in the midst of the confusion ran to get
life-preservers, and everybody else, except Jack Hazard,
seemed to be staggered by the calamity, and gazed out on
the water with bulged eyes.</p>

<p>But the boy never lost his head.</p>

<p>Jack whipped off his jacket, mounted the rail, and leaped
into the water.</p>

<p>He struck out lustily for the spot where the child had
gone down, and presently saw one little arm and a portion
of her golden hair appear on the surface not far away.</p>

<p>“There she is,” he murmured, and redoubled his efforts
to reach her before she should go down again.</p>

<p>But she went under again before he could seize her, and
the plucky boy dived.</p>

<p>Though encumbered by his clothes, Jack was so much at
home in the water that he had little difficulty in following
the descent of the bright-hued dress the child wore, and
he had one arm about the unconscious little one in a brief
space of time.</p>

<p>Kicking out with all his might, he rose to the surface
like a duck.</p>

<p>A life-preserver floated near.</p>

<p>Resting the little girl’s head on it, he pushed it before
him toward the ferryboat, the rail and end of which were
now black with excited people.</p>

<p>Several deck hands were standing outside the folding
guards with ropes in their hands, and the moment Jack
was seen to be within reach one of them flung his line so
that it struck the water close to him.</p>

<p>He seized the end with his disengaged hand, and the men
began to pull him in at once.</p>

<p>Less than ten minutes from the time the girl was pitched
into the river Jack had her back on board and regained
the deck himself.</p>

<p>Dripping like a large Newfoundland, he was instantly
surrounded by an admiring group of passengers loud in
their commendations on his courage and presence of mind.</p>

<p>At the same time another throng gathered about the
unconscious child, its well-nigh frantic mother, and the
white-haired old gentleman.</p>

<p>“Come down into the boiler-room, young fellow,” spoke
up a strapping deck hand, “and we’ll dry your clothes for
you.”</p>

<p>And Jack, glad to get rid of the attentions of the crowd,
followed his guide to the warm regions beneath the engine-room.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed a grimy-faced stoker. “Been overboard,
eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he has,” said the deck hand. “Done
what’ll put his name in the papers, Jim. Jumped overboard
after a little gal that fell in from the rail where she was
sitting when that barge run us afoul.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” cried Jim. “Tip us your flipper, lad;
you’ve got the real thing in you, all right.”</p>

<p>“Strip, young man. It won’t take but a moment or two
to take the moisture out of your clothes down here. I
reckon you’ll find it hotter than blazes afore you leave.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t every fellow would do what you did,” said the
sweating coal-heaver, admiringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mind it; I’m a good swimmer,” said Jack,
modestly.</p>

<p>“You ought to make a stake out of this,” said the man,
hanging the dripping garments about to the best advantage.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“The little gal’s people ought to be grateful enough to
hand you out something handsome.”</p>

<p>“If it’s money you mean,” replied the boy, stoutly, “I
shouldn’t accept a cent.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t?” gasped the man, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Not a nickel.”</p>

<p>“Why not? You’re entitled to something. You ought
to have a new suit of clothes at any rate&mdash;the best that
can be bought.”</p>

<p>Jack was silent.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re well off and don’t want nothing,” said
the stoker, after giving the furnace a rake with a long iron
implement.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not well off; but I don’t take money for such
a service as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a curious kind of chap,” replied the man,
scratching his head and looking the naked but well-formed
lad over from his head down. “I’d take money mighty
quick if ’twas me as done the trick. I s’pose you’re too
proud, eh?”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to understand,” said Jack, who wished
the fellow would talk about something else.</p>

<p>“Say,” came a voice down the stoke-hole, “send up that
young fellow as soon as his things are dried. The gal’s
folks have been asking for him and want to see him bad.”</p>

<p class="h2sub">IN WHICH JACK GETS A JOB IN WALL STREET.</p>

<p>“What is your name, my boy?” asked the white-haired
old gentleman who had accompanied the lady and the little
girl on the ferryboat when, a little later, just before the
boat was ready to start on her return trip across the river,
Jack presented himself in his wrinkled and not thoroughly
dried clothes before him in the waiting-room of the ferry-house.</p>

<p>The little girl and her mother had been taken to a nearby
hotel, in order that the child’s garments could be removed.</p>

<p>“Jack Hazard.”</p>

<p>“And my name is Seymour Atherton. Well, Jack,
you have placed my daughter and myself under the greatest
of obligations to you. You are a brave lad. Your
courage and presence of mind saved the life of our dearest
treasure, and it would be utterly impossible for us to thank
you sufficiently.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll not let that trouble you, sir. I’m glad
to have been of service to you.”</p>

<p>“Young man, it would trouble us a great deal more than
you have any idea of if we did not make some little return
that will show our appreciation of your gallant deed.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to be paid for doing my duty, sir,”
objected Jack, with a flush.</p>

<p>“I am not speaking about payment, my lad, in the sense
you perhaps imagine. Such a service as you have rendered
us is quite beyond monetary reward,” said the old gentleman,
feelingly. “But it is not impossible that we can do
something in another way. I like your face. It is a
bright one, stamped with energy and determination. You
will make your way in the world, I have not the least doubt.
It will do you no harm to ‘have a friend at court,’ as the
saying is. You must let us know you better.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no objection to that,” said the boy, with a frank
smile.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Mr. Atherton, cheerfully. “Now, in
the first place, you have almost ruined your clothes. It is
only fair that you allow me to buy you a new suit at once.”</p>

<p>To this offer Jack made no objection.</p>

<p>So he permitted the old gentleman to take him to a large
furnishing goods store, where he was fitted out with new
underclothes, shirt, tie, etc., and from thence to a clothing
establishment, where one of the best suits was placed at his
disposal, his own clothes being wrapped up and ordered
to be sent to his home.</p>

<p>“Now you must come with me to the hotel and let me
introduce you to my daughter and the little girl who owes
you such a debt of gratitude, which when she grows older
she will realize.”</p>

<p>Jack put up some little objection, but was overruled.</p>

<p>“I presume you are out on some business for the house
with which you are employed, but if you will give me the
name and address I will make it all right for you.”</p>

<p>Then Jack blushingly admitted that he was out of work
and had come to Brooklyn in search of a position which he
had seen advertised.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” remarked the old gentleman. “It will give me
great pleasure to put you in the way of what you are in
search, and at the same time give me an opportunity of
knowing you better. How would you like to work in Wall
Street?”</p>

<p>“I should like it very much indeed,” said Jack, eagerly.</p>

<p>“My son will need a messenger boy in a day or so, as
the lad he has is about to leave. You shall have the place.
I will telephone to him from the hotel and secure the position
for you at once.”</p>

<p>“I thank you very much, sir,” said the boy gratefully.
“My mother and sister depend largely on me, and I am
sorry to say that I really need a job very badly.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to know that I can be of use to you in so
important a particular,” said the old gentleman, in a tone
of satisfaction. “Here we are; let us go in.”</p>

<p>The first thing Mr. Atherton did was to get in communication
with his son, a Wall Street banker and broker,
and he had no difficulty in making good his promise to
Jack.</p>

<p>Then they went upstairs in the hotel to the room that
had been temporarily engaged by Mrs. Bruce (which was
the name of Mr. Atherton’s daughter).</p>

<p>“Laura, dear, this is Jack Hazard, the boy who saved
our little Fanny’s life. You may remember he was standing
near us at the time Fanny fell into the river.”</p>

<p>We will not repeat what Mrs. Bruce said to Jack.</p>

<p>She felt as all fond mothers do feel under the circumstances,
and expressed herself accordingly.</p>

<p>She was deeply grateful for what the boy had done, and
she brought him over to the bed where little Fanny lay
covered up, waiting for her garments to dry, and made the
child kiss him and say, “T’ank oo, Jack.”</p>

<p>While it is very nice to be praised, and all that, for doing
a plucky action, still our hero rather objected, on the
whole, to be made a hero of.</p>

<p>He was glad when the interview was over and he was
permitted to take his leave with a letter from Mr. Atherton
in his pocket addressed to “William Atherton,&mdash;Wall
Street,” accompanied with instructions to present same
immediately.</p>

<p>It was a vastly different boy that walked across the
Brooklyn bridge about eleven o’clock from the one who a
couple of hours before had crossed the river on the Fulton
Ferry.</p>

<p>His thrilling adventure, with its attendant results, had
left an indelible mark upon him.</p>

<p>He seemed to have grown older and more manly all at
once.</p>

<p>Not only that, but was now assured of a position&mdash;and
a good one, at that&mdash;in a section of the city and a business
he had more than once regarded with envy.</p>

<p>“Won’t mother and sis be glad when I go home and
tell them,” he mused as he stepped out with unusual vigor
and glanced around on the promenade with eyes that fairly
brimmed over with happiness. “Yes; I feel I’ve got the
chance of my life, and if I don’t improve it, my name isn’t
Jack Hazard.”</p>

<p>He found &mdash;&mdash; Wall Street without any trouble, and he
saw that the offices of William Atherton were on the second
floor.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Atherton in?” he inquired of a clerk.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he is engaged at present. What is your business
with him?”</p>

<p>“Please give him this letter.”</p>

<p>“Any answer?” asked the clerk as he took it.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“Take a seat,” said the clerk, brusquely, and walked
away.</p>

<p>In a moment or two Jack was requested to walk into the
private office, and there found himself face to face with a
well-built, florid-complexioned man of perhaps forty, who
pointed to a chair alongside his desk and then regarded the
boy keenly for a moment or two before he spoke.</p>

<p>“I see you have rendered our family a special service,
young man,” said William Atherton, in a genial way. “I
should be glad if you would give me the particulars, as I
am naturally very much interested.”</p>

<p>Jack with all due modesty related in as few words as
possible how he had saved the life of little Fanny Bruce.</p>

<p>“You certainly deserve every word my father has said
about you in his letter. To his gratitude I will now add
mine&mdash;that ought to cover both our sentiments fully. And
now I understand you wish to enter this office as a messenger.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will give me trial,” said Jack, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. You are recommended by my father,
and what little I know about you pleases me. You look
to be apt and bright. Are you well acquainted with the
lower part of the city?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“With whom were you last employed?”</p>

<p>Jack told him, and said he could refer to the members
of the late firm.</p>

<p>“It is scarcely necessary under the circumstances. Just
write your full name and address on that pad. Thank you.
That will be all. Your wages will be seven dollars to commence
with, and I shall advance you as circumstances permit.
You can start in to-morrow morning. The hours are
nine to five. Report to Mr. Bishop.”</p>

<p>When Jack left the office he was the happiest boy in New
York.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">HOW JACK PROPOSES TO RAISE THE RENT MONEY.</p>

<p>Jack was quite unprepared for the shock that awaited him
when he reached home early that afternoon in high spirits.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he cried, dashing impetuously into the room
where Mrs. Hazard was assisting her daughter with her
work, “what do you think? I’ve got a dandy place in
Wall Street, and I’m to get seven dollars to commence with.
Why, what’s the matter?” He stopped suddenly and regarded
them with some surprise. “You’ve both been crying.
What’s up?”</p>

<p>“We’ve met with a terrible misfortune, John,” replied
his mother.</p>

<p>“Why, what has happened?” and the boy sat down with
a shade of apprehension in his face.</p>

<p>“The money we had for the rent&mdash;&mdash;” began Mrs.
Hazard, slowly.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone!” gasped Jack.</p>

<p>“We think it was taken by somebody,” put in Annie,
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that!”</p>

<p>A few words of explanation made him as wise on the
subject as they were themselves, and the boy looked down
ruefully at the carpet.</p>

<p>“So you think Maggie McFadden may have taken it?”
he said, presently.</p>

<p>“There was nobody else in here to-day,” said Annie.</p>

<p>“As you didn’t actually see her take it, of course we can’t
accuse her. She must have found out that you kept money
in that drawer and made up her mind to steal it at the
first chance. She must have been pretty slick to get away
with it right under your nose. Well, it’s pretty tough. I
never thought much of the McFaddens. Maggie isn’t my
style of a girl, and Denny, her brother, hangs ’round with
a crowd that I wouldn’t think of associating with. He
blows in most of his wages on horse-racing. Well, mother,
how are we going to pay the rent?”</p>

<p>“That’s what worries me. The agent was here and was
much put out because I could not pay him. He has allowed
me three days to get the money together again. If the rent
is not paid by Friday he told me we’d have to move.”</p>

<p>“Gee! This is simply fierce! And to think that everything
looked so bright to me a while ago!”</p>

<p>“If I only knew where I could borrow fifteen dollars,
we could pay it back in a little while, now that you have
secured a position,” said Mrs. Hazard.</p>

<p>“You got the situation through one of the ‘World’ ads,
didn’t you, John?” asked his sister.</p>

<p>“No, sis; and you could never guess how I did get it.
They don’t often advertise those kind of jobs.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said Annie, curiously, “do tell us how you
got it, then.”</p>

<p>“Why, John,” interrupted his mother, in a tone of great
surprise, “where on earth did you get those clothes? I
didn’t notice them till this moment,” and she came over
and examined his new suit closely. “Why, it looks like an
expensive suit!”</p>

<p>“I guess it is, mother,” laughed Jack. “It was one of
the best in the store.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack,” cried his sister, eagerly, “do tell us how
you came to get it. Where are the clothes you had on this
morning when you left home?”</p>

<p>“I expect they will be delivered here some time to-day.
The fact of the matter is, I took a hasty bath in the East
River.”</p>

<p>“John,” gasped his mother, “what are you talking
about?”</p>

<p>Whereupon Jack related his exciting experiences of the
morning and how it had led to his getting the position of
messenger in Mr. Atherton’s office.</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed his sister, excitedly, “you’ll have your
name in the papers, and everybody will be calling you a
hero.”</p>

<p>“I hope they won’t lose any sleep over the matter; I
know I sha’n’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, the little girl would have been drowned only for
you.”</p>

<p>“I guess she would,” admitted Jack. “I didn’t expect
to get anything for what I did; but all the same, I’m not
kicking because I was presented with a good job. We
need the money, sis.”</p>

<p>“When do you begin your duties?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning at nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“And when do you get through?”</p>

<p>“Five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, you have bankers’ hours, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would be,” smiled his sister. “Now,
if we hadn’t lost the rent money, I think we would all be
perfectly happy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see but that you’ll have to let me pawn a few of
your trinkets, mother. Whatever we’ll lack to make up the
full amount I may be able to borrow from Ed Potter. If
he’s got it, he’ll let me have it right off the reel.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always had a horror for a pawnshop,” said Mrs.
Hazard, with a little shudder. “It brings the realization of
one’s circumstances too much to heart.”</p>

<p>“I know, mother; but I don’t see how we can avoid
patronizing the place under our present emergency. We
must have the rent.”</p>

<p>“True,” answered his mother, with a sigh; “but I won’t
agree to let you go there until the last moment.”</p>

<p>That night Jack got three dollars from his friend Ed,
and at the same time told him he had got a situation in
Wall Street.</p>

<p>Potter was delighted to hear that his chum had secured
such a fine job.</p>

<p>“It’s a great sight better than printing,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I hear the men in our office every day say the trade is
going to the dogs on account of the machines.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, an operator on a Mergenthaler can stack
up forty thousand ems per day and upward, according to
the copy and his expertness, while a hand compositor is
lucky to average eight thousand. So, you see, the piece
hands, as they call ’em, aren’t wanted any more.”</p>

<p>“And that has thrown a lot of printers out of work,
has it?”</p>

<p>“Rather.”</p>

<p>“And how do they make a living, then?”</p>

<p>“Some of them don’t. However, there’s a relief fund for
Union men that helps ’em out. Many of the old piece
hands have turned to be jobbers, and some of them have
got to be proofreaders. I’m getting tired of the business
myself, so if you hear of something that you think I could
tackle, I’m ready to make a change.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my eyes open, Ed. I’d like to have you down
on Wall Street with me.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack Hazard!” exclaimed another boy, a mutual
friend of both, named Wally Gray, joining them on the
corner. “How does your head feel?”</p>

<p>“Why, how should it feel?” asked Jack, in surprise.</p>

<p>“I thought it looked kind of swelled,” grinned Wally.</p>

<p>“What are you giving me?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you know all about it,” Wally said to Ed.</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“Why, Jack, of course.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he told you what he did this morning?”</p>

<p>“Say, Jack,” asked Ed, in a puzzled way, “what is Wally
barking about?”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t read to-night’s ‘World’ or ‘Journal’,”
continued Wally, grinning.</p>

<p>“No; I came out a little while ago to get the sporting
edition, as I’m a crank on baseball.”</p>

<p>“Then run over to the stand and buy one, and I’ll show
you something that’ll surprise you. Hold on; you needn’t.
Here’s a boy with a bunch of ’em.”</p>

<p>Ed bought a paper.</p>

<p>Wally grabbed it and presently pointed out an article the
nature of which Jack knew fully, for he had bought an
earlier edition of two afternoon papers for his mother and
sister.</p>

<p>It was a pretty correct account of the rescue of little
Fanny Bruce, daughter of George Bruce, of Chicago, and
granddaughter of Seymour Atherton, a retired New York
stock broker, who had fallen from a Fulton ferryboat into
the East River, by a lad of eighteen, named Jack Hazard,
who lived at No. 80 &mdash;&mdash; Street.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Ed, with bulging eyes. “Was
that really you?”</p>

<p>Jack grinned.</p>

<p>“You never said a word to me about it, and we’ve been
standing here half an hour,” said Potter, in an injured
tone.</p>

<p>“I didn’t feel like blowing my horn on the subject, and
I knew you’d see the account in the paper after you’d gone
over the baseball news.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blowed if this isn’t a surprise,” said Ed.</p>

<p>“It knocked me all lopsided,” chipped in Wally.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’ve been interviewed by the reporters like any
other great man?” said Ed, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen one or two.”</p>

<p>“You ought to make a good thing out of this, Jack. The
paper says that the old gent is a money-bag,” said Ed, with
a twinkle in his eye. “Didn’t he hand you a liberal check?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look like it, does it, when I’ve just borrowed
three dollars off you?”</p>

<p>“That’s right; but I s’pose he’ll stump up in a day
or so.”</p>

<p>“What for?” demanded Jack, sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, for yanking his granddaughter out of the wet, of
course,” grinned Ed.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! He won’t do anything of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll be a mighty mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” cried Jack. “He’s done all I would
accept. He got me my job, and I’m perfectly satisfied.”</p>

<p>“That’s something, of course; but you’ll have to work
for all the money you’ll get out of that. He might have
given you a nice present also.”</p>

<p>“He presented me with a new suit of clothes.”</p>

<p>“What’s that? Didn’t you get your own soaked?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not kicking, so I guess we’ll talk about something
else.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the three boys parted company.</p>

<p class="h2sub">HOW JACK ADDS ANOTHER FEATHER TO HIS CAP.</p>

<p>Next morning Jack appeared at Mr. William Atherton’s
office a few minutes before nine o’clock, ready for business.</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop hadn’t arrived, so the boy took a seat in
the outer office and waited for him.</p>

<p>He came about ten minutes later, and Jack reported to
him as he had been told to do.</p>

<p>The manager looked him over attentively and seemed
to be pleased with his looks.</p>

<p>“Well, Jack,” said Mr. Bishop, “Mr. Atherton has spoken
to me about you. You seem to be a smart boy, and that
is what we want here. You appear to have acquired something
of a reputation for nerve and cool-headedness for one
so young. You have made good friends for yourself by
your courageous act of yesterday, which, I see, is reported
in the morning papers. It remains for you now to justify
the excellent opinion they have formed of you. Now, as
to your immediate duties, you will, for the rest of the week,
assist our messenger, whose place you have been employed
to fill. He will leave on Saturday. I presume you are
tolerably acquainted with the financial district.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, respectfully.</p>

<p>“Very good. Now come inside, and I will make you
acquainted with the boy you are to succeed.”</p>

<p>Frank Simpson, the messenger, was perched on a high
stool at a desk, sorting over a pile of papers for the head
clerk.</p>

<p>He was a pleasant-featured boy of fifteen and appeared
to be glad to know his successor.</p>

<p>“Where have you been working?” he asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I was employed by Hogg &amp; Newman, in Stone Street,
but the firm went up a couple of weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“Never worked in Wall Street, then?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve struck a dandy place when you caught on
here. How did you come to get the tip?”</p>

<p>Evidently Simpson hadn’t read about Jack’s adventure
in the papers.</p>

<p>“Mr. Seymour Atherton sent me here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see; you are acquainted with the old gent.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded, but did not mention how that acquaintance
came about.</p>

<p>“Then I guess you’re solid, all right,” added Simpson.
“There, I’m through now. Come outside.”</p>

<p>The two boys walked into the outer office and took possession
of a couple of chairs in a corner.</p>

<p>“This is your post. When the boss or the manager
wants you he taps a bell and you answer it&mdash;see?”</p>

<p>Jack understood, and an instant later Mr. Bishop’s bell
sounded.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the call,” said Simpson, skipping over to the
manager’s private office.</p>

<p>He was back in a moment.</p>

<p>“You’re to deliver this envelope at the address, on Exchange
Place, and wait for an answer. I’m off for the
Seaman’s Bank.”</p>

<p>The boys seized their hats, descended the stairs together
with a hop, skip and a jump, and parted at the door.</p>

<p>Jack turned down Broad Street, crossed over, passed the
Stock Exchange, and hastened along until he came to Exchange
Place, a narrow thoroughfare, more like a lane than
a street, which was somewhat gloomy even on the brightest
days because of the tall buildings that fringed both sides.</p>

<p>He easily found the number he wanted, took an elevator,
and was carried to the top floor.</p>

<p>“Number Ninety-six, to your left,” said the elevator
man as Jack stepped out into the corridor.</p>

<p>Numberless doors, the upper part of which were fitted with
frosted glass bearing the name of a firm, stared the boy in
the face as he hurried forward and turned down a shorter
corridor to the left as he had been directed to do.</p>

<p>No. 96 was at the extreme end of the corridor facing
him, so he had nothing to do but walk straight ahead, turn
the handle of the door and enter.</p>

<p>He delivered the envelope to a dudish-looking clerk and
then flopped down on a cane chair.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a sudden commotion in the
private office of the firm.</p>

<p>All the clerks looked up in a startled way as a man’s
voice exclaimed, in hoarse accents:</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m utterly ruined! I can’t deliver that stock
by noon, and since you refuse to let up on me, Hartz, there’s
nothing left for me to do but this&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy, man&mdash;put down that revolver!” in lower
but not less excited tones.</p>

<p>The words were followed by the noise of a struggle in
the private office.</p>

<p>A heavy chair was overturned, and then the second voice
cried, “Help!”</p>

<p>Every one of the clerks dropped his pen and started for
the little door marked “Private,” but before one could reach
it the door flew open with a bang, and a big man, wild-eyed
and disheveled, appeared, struggling to shake off the hold
of a smaller man with a sharp cast of countenance, who
had a firm grip on his right arm, in the hand of which
was grasped a cocked revolver.</p>

<p>“I tell you I will do it!” cried the large man, in frenzied
tones, making a violent effort to free himself.</p>

<p>He swung Hartz, who was the head of the firm that occupied
the offices, around as if he had been a feather, flooring
three of the clerks, who went down like so many cornstalks
before the sweep of the old-time scythe.</p>

<p>And Hartz, losing his grip, went on top of them.</p>

<p>The big man, then rushing clear of the group, raised the
revolver to his head.</p>

<p>But Jack, who had jumped to his feet at the commencement
of the rumpus, divining his intention, cleared the
rail at a bound and grabbed his arm just as he pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>The sharp explosion mingled with the splintering of glass
as the bullet grazed the would-be suicide’s temple and
crashed through the window pane fronting on Exchange
Place.</p>

<p>Partly stunned, the desperate man staggered forward two
or three feet and then sank down, while Jack succeeded in
wrenching the pistol from his relaxed fingers.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Hartz and his clerks had picked themselves
up and were looking with blanched faces at the fallen
visitor, down whose pale countenance trickled a thin stream
of blood, from which they seemed to infer that the big man
had succeeded in destroying himself.</p>

<p>The shot had aroused all the offices along the corridor,
and brokers, clerks, visitors, and others came rushing out.</p>

<p>Nobody knew exactly whence the report had come, but
somebody opened Hartz’s door and looked in, and he saw
enough to satisfy him of the true state of affairs.</p>

<p>Others crowded in after him, and soon the intelligence
flew through the building that a man had committed suicide
in Broker Hartz’s office.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” cried Hartz, waving his
arms. “Please don’t crowd in here. Schultz,” to a clerk,
“telephone to the precinct station for an officer and a doctor.
Gentlemen, I beg of you to stand back.”</p>

<p>Jack, kneeling beside the big man, wiped the blood away
from the scalp wound.</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right in a minute or two,” said the boy to
the excited broker, who seemed to have lost his head over
the affair.</p>

<p>“He didn’t kill himself, eh?” said Hartz, in shaky tones.</p>

<p>“No; I grabbed the revolver in the nick of time.”</p>

<p>“Where did the bullet go?”</p>

<p>“It smashed one of your window panes.”</p>

<p>“What have you done with the revolver?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“You’d better let me have it before he revives.”</p>

<p>“He’s coming to now,” said Jack, handing the weapon
to the broker, who rushed into his private office and hid it.</p>

<p>The big man, whose name Jack had found out was Oliver
Bird, recovered his senses and looked blankly around as if
he didn’t comprehend what had happened to him or where
he was.</p>

<p>“How do you feel now, sir?” asked Jack, assisting him
to rise.</p>

<p>“Feel? Why, what’s the matter with me? I didn’t have
a fit, did I?”</p>

<p>The boy didn’t feel like making an explanation, for he
knew the man would realize the situation in a moment.</p>

<p>“Let me assist you into the private office, sir,” he suggested,
thinking it well that Mr. Bird should be removed
from the curious gaze and remarks of the outsiders who
blocked up the space outside the railing.</p>

<p>Oliver Bird made no objection to this, but as soon as
his eyes fell on the face of Mr. Hartz everything came back
to him like a flash.</p>

<p>He glared at the broker, and for a moment it looked to
Jack as if there was going to be trouble.</p>

<p>Hartz, however, staved it off by saying, quickly:</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Bird, and we’ll talk the matter over
again. I’ve decided to let you have twenty-four hours in
which to settle up.”</p>

<p>As Bird sank into the chair, apparently pacified, Jack
retired and shut the door.</p>

<p>“You’ve got something going back to Atherton’s, haven’t
you?” he said to the dude clerk.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I don’t know what I did with that
envelope you brought. This excitement knocked it out of
my mind.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s sticking out of your pocket,” said Jack,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Bless me! So it is. Just wait a moment.” And he
rushed over to the head bookkeeper, who, with the cashier,
was trying to induce the mob to leave.</p>

<p>Jack had to wait several minutes before another envelope
was handed to him to take back.</p>

<p>While he was waiting for it several of the clerks gathered
about him, complimented him on his nerve and presence of
mind, and asked him his name.</p>

<p>On his way to the elevator he passed an officer and a man
in plain clothes, aiming for Hartz’s office.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he said to himself, “I guess it’s a mighty lucky
thing for Bird I was on hand. He evidently meant to put
that bullet into his brains.”</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">WHAT JACK PICKED UP ON WALL STREET.</p>

<p>“Hello! What kept you so long?” exclaimed Frank
Simpson when Jack entered the outer office on his return
from his Exchange Place errand.</p>

<p>“There was a little excitement over at Hartz’s office that
tangled everybody up. I’ll tell you about it in a moment.”
And Jack steered himself into the manager’s office, delivered
the envelope, and explained the cause of the delay.</p>

<p>“What! Oliver Bird tried to blow his brains out in
Hartz’s office, eh? I heard he was one of the shorts that
were badly squeezed yesterday in D. P. &amp; Q. stock,” said
Mr. Bishop. “How did the affair end?”</p>

<p>Jack explained as modestly as possible the hand he had
had in the matter.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, you saved the man’s life, then. Why,
Bird is a big, strong man, and he must have been half
crazy at the time. How did you manage to do it?”</p>

<p>“I made a jump and grabbed his hand just as he pulled
the trigger. That’s all I know about it.”</p>

<p>“Your presence of mind prevented a sad tragedy. Bird
is a good fellow, and it is evident Hartz turned the screws
on him down to the last notch. Nothing short of absolute
ruin would cause Oliver to lose his head. The fact that
he had a revolver shows that he went to Hartz in a desperate
frame of mind. It seems to me, young man,” added
Mr. Bishop, with a smile, “that you are determined to keep
your name before the public. If you are not interviewed
by a reporter inside of thirty minutes I shall be much surprised.”</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, you’re a wonder!” exclaimed Frank Simpson,
after the new messenger had narrated to him the affair
at Hartz’s office. “I’ve just been reading the account in
the ‘Herald’ of how you saved the boss’s niece, Fanny, from
drowning in the East River. All the clerks are talking
about you. Gee! I wish I had your nerve!”</p>

<p>But the two boys hadn’t much time for talking.</p>

<p>Business was beginning to rush on Wall Street.</p>

<p>Simpson was presently sent on an errand down Broad
Street, and shortly afterward Jack was sent to the New
Street entrance of the Stock Exchange with an envelope
for Mr. Atherton, who was busy on the floor.</p>

<p>It was several minutes before he was able to reach Mr.
Atherton, and during that interval the boy gazed upon the
tumultuous scene before him with something like wonder,
for it was new to him.</p>

<p>The crowd of brokers was divided into a dozen or more
groups, more or less clearly defined, shrinking or increasing
in size from time to time as the excitement grew or waned
around that particular bone of contention.</p>

<p>And the roar and hubbub flowed and ebbed in like manner
in different sections of the Exchange floor.</p>

<p>“I’ll sell a thousand at eighty-six and an eighth!”
shouted Mr. Atherton.</p>

<p>At this, half a dozen clamorous hands were raised and
shaken at him furiously.</p>

<p>“Any part of a thousand at eighty-six,” continued the
broker.</p>

<p>At this, Jack saw Hartz break into the circle with his
hand upraised and a wild Comanche yell.</p>

<p>Atherton said something, and both men made entries on
their tablets.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Mr. Atherton withdrew from the
bunch, and then Jack saw his opportunity to deliver his
message.</p>

<p>He received several slips in return, with orders to hurry
back to the office.</p>

<p>Simpson was out, and he had no chance this time to
warm the seat of the chair, for Mr. Bishop sent him out
again immediately.</p>

<p>And he was kept on the go with scarcely a chance to
swallow a cup of coffee and eat a sandwich, until after the
Exchange closed, at three o’clock.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bird has been here inquiring for you, Jack,” said
Mr. Bishop, as the lad laid the firm’s bank-book on his
desk after making the day’s deposit. “He wants to see
you at his office. You had better run over now.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.” And the lad passed out into the street
again.</p>

<p>As he approached the entrance of a certain prominent
trust company he noticed a large envelope lying on the
pavement.</p>

<p>Three or four persons passed it by, and one of them actually
trod on it.</p>

<p>It looked as though it had been discarded by some one,
and Jack, whose first idea had been to pick it up, felt
ashamed to touch it lest some of the kids coming along
should give him the laugh.</p>

<p>He was about to pass it when a D. T. messenger, rushing
out of the trust company, gave it a kick, sending it flying
against Jack’s feet, and then the boy concluded to examine
it, for the way it had flown through the air showed it to
be at least a bit weightier than an empty envelope.</p>

<p>And it was, for a fact.</p>

<p>As Jack hurried on, he counted six one-thousand-dollar,
one five-hundred-dollar, and two one-hundred-dollar bank-notes.
And that was all. No memorandum, and no name
or address either inside or outside.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” he exclaimed. “Sixty seven hundred dollars,
and no clue to the owner! And to think I’d have
passed it by like a score of other people have done, if it
hadn’t been for that little messenger kid kicking it almost
into my hands. Who does it belong to? Some fellows
might say&mdash;and Denny McFadden is one of that kind&mdash;that
findings is keepings, but I’m not built that way. I’ll
hand it over to Mr. Bishop, and perhaps he will hear of the
party that lost it. At any rate, it doesn’t belong to me,
and I have no right to keep it.”</p>

<p>Jack, who had been brought up to regard honesty as the
best policy, stowed the envelope away in an inside pocket
of his jacket, and then mounted the stairs leading to Oliver
Bird’s office.</p>

<p>The boy was admitted to Mr. Bird’s inner sanctum, and
the big broker no sooner recognized him than he jumped
up from his desk, and, seizing him by both hands, shook
them warmly.</p>

<p>“By George! I don’t know how to thank you for saving
my life this morning,” he said, in a voice that quivered
with emotion. “I certainly was not in my right senses
at the time, and but for your quickness and nerve I would
have been a corpse a moment later. Think what a shock
you have saved my family! Young man, I shall be grateful
to you all my life.”</p>

<p>And while he spoke he held on to the boy’s hands.</p>

<p>“All I can say, Mr. Bird, is that I am glad I happened
to be on hand,” said Jack, frankly. “I hope you won’t
worry about what you owe me. I’d have done the same
thing for anyone else under the same circumstances.”</p>

<p>“But I shall worry about it, young man, until I have
done something for you to show my gratitude.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to do anything for me, sir. I’m perfectly
satisfied with knowing that I saved you from doing a
rash act.”</p>

<p>“But that won’t satisfy me.”</p>

<p>Jack was silent.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bishop told me that you are the boy who saved Mr.
Atherton’s little niece from drowning yesterday morning.
Most of the brokers have read about it in the papers this
morning, and I have heard a score of them talking about
you. And now this crazy act of mine is printed in all
the afternoon editions, and I’ll bet if there is one there
are a hundred men about the Street who are trying to get
a chance to see what sort of a boy you look like. Nobody
seems to know you as yet. How long have you been working
for Atherton?”</p>

<p>“This is my first day,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought you were new down here, else I had
probably seen you before. I asked Hartz and his chief
clerk about you, but they could tell me nothing more than
that you came there from Atherton’s, and that was the
only way I located you. Now I want you to call at my
house to-night; will you? My wife will certainly insist on
seeing you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack, who felt that it wouldn’t be polite
to refuse the broker’s request.</p>

<p>“I’ll try and call about eight o’clock,” said the boy, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“I shall expect you,” said Mr. Bird, shaking him again
warmly by the hand as Jack bade him good-bye and left.</p>

<p>On his return to the office Jack asked Mr. Bishop if he
could see him for a moment.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the manager.</p>

<p>“I wish to put this in your hands till it is claimed by
the rightful owner,” said the boy, handing Mr. Bishop the
envelope with its precious contents.</p>

<p>“Why, where did you pick it up?” asked the astonished
manager after he had counted the bills.</p>

<p>“On Wall Street, this side of the Blank Trust Company.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop looked at him earnestly.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any greater evidence than this that you
are a thoroughly honest lad,” he said, emphatically. “Mr.
Atherton will be greatly pleased to hear of this. It would
certainly be a great temptation for many boys, and for that
matter, many men, to hold on to this money and say nothing
about it&mdash;the more especially as there is nothing either
on or inside the envelope to identify the owner. I will be
glad to attend to the matter. As the amount is a large
one, it will probably be advertised for at once. Whatever
reward is offered, it will of course be quite right for you
to accept.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop deposited the envelope, just as it was, in the
office safe, and soon afterward the office closed for the day,
and Jack started to walk uptown, stopping on Vandewater
Street for his chum, Ed Potter, who got away at 5:30.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">IN WHICH JACK RESTORES THE OBLONG YELLOW ENVELOPE
AND ITS CONTENTS TO ITS OWNER.</p>

<p>Of course Jack had a budget of interesting news to tell
his mother and sister at the supper table that night.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! How could you do it?” exclaimed Annie
when he described how he grabbed the loaded revolver just
as Oliver Bird fired it.</p>

<p>“Well, sis, I never stopped to consider why I did it&mdash;the
whole thing was over in a moment.”</p>

<p>“And you actually saved the man’s life?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bird is sure of it, and that’s the way the evening
papers put it, so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What! Is it printed in the paper? Let me see,” cried
his sister, excitedly.</p>

<p>Jack pointed out the article to her, and she began to
read it with a great deal of interest.</p>

<p>“But that isn’t all that happened to me,” grinned the
lad, with his mouth full of Irish stew.</p>

<p>“I should think that was enough for one day, John,”
said his mother, smiling.</p>

<p>“I found an envelope with a wad of money in it.”</p>

<p>“Jack Hazard, you don’t mean it!” cried Annie, dropping
the paper at this startling bit of intelligence.</p>

<p>“I don’t usually say what I don’t mean, sis.”</p>

<p>“You really and truly did find some money? How
much?”</p>

<p>“You promise you won’t faint?”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bishop and myself both counted it. It amounted
to sixty seven hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>Mother and daughter both held up their hands in amazement.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s a fortune!”</p>

<p>“It would be to us; but probably the man who lost it
considers such an amount a mere bagatelle.”</p>

<p>“Did you find the owner?”</p>

<p>“No; there was nothing in the envelope to identify the
person to whom the money belonged. Mr. Bishop says we
may expect to see it advertised for, probably to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Surely you will get something for returning the
money,” said his sister.</p>

<p>“I shall be satisfied if I get fifteen dollars, so mother can
pay the agent Friday.”</p>

<p>“You ought to get a great deal more than that. A good
many people would keep that money, had they found it in
the way you did. You ought to get at least one hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I’m offered a hundred I sha’n’t refuse it, sis.
You and mother need a new dress each, and I should like
to get them for you.”</p>

<p>“It’s very like you, Jack, to think of us first; but we’ll
talk about all that when we see what you do realize out of
your find.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack, helping himself to another hot
biscuit.</p>

<p>“The whole neighborhood is talking about you, Jack,”
said his sister. “More than a dozen people whom we never
saw before were in here to-day talking to mother and saying
ever so many flattering things about you. Now, when they
read to-night’s paper I’m afraid we shall have another crowd
to-morrow. Why, you’ll be considered a regular hero.”</p>

<p>“I’d like it better if they wouldn’t interest themselves so
much with our affairs, sis,” said Jack, in a tone of annoyance.
“They wouldn’t make themselves so prominent if
we were dispossessed because we couldn’t pay our rent.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to submit with the best grace
we can. It is one of the penalties of newspaper notoriety.”</p>

<p>After supper Jack started to walk uptown to No. &mdash;&mdash; East
Sixty-second Street, as he didn’t feel that he could afford
carfare.</p>

<p>He reached Mr. Bird’s residence, a four-story brownstone
front, a little after eight o’clock.</p>

<p>He was very kindly received by the broker and his family,
who regarded him as the savior of the household.</p>

<p>He spent a very pleasant hour, and when he insisted that
it was time for him to go Mrs. Bird stepped up and presented
him with a very handsome little gold watch and
chain as a small token of their gratitude and esteem.</p>

<p>Jack was very much surprised, not expecting anything
of the kind, and for the first time in his life he was at
a loss how to suitably express himself.</p>

<p>The very first thing Jack did next morning when he
reached the office was to look over the “Lost and Found”
column in the “Herald,” but he failed to find anything
having reference to the money he had found.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Frank Simpson, who sat beside him,
reading the ‘World.’ “Say, this is pretty tough!”</p>

<p>“What’s tough?” asked Jack, without looking up.</p>

<p>“Why, here’s a story about a woman who lost a big wad
of money yesterday.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jack, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>“She and her husband had been saving up and pinching
themselves for the last twenty years to save enough money
to buy a house where they could spend their old age in
security and comfort. They did buy a house, but the city
took it on a valuation because it stood in the way of the
new bridge, and they received sixty seven hundred dollars.
They left this money with the Blank Trust Company, on
Wall Street. After looking around some time, they bought
another house, and yesterday the woman drew the money
from the trust company to pay for it and for the new furniture
and other things they wanted; but when she got home
she found that she had lost the envelope containing the
money somewhere on the street, but just where she has no
idea. She’s about crazy over her loss. Gee whiz! If that
isn’t hard luck, I don’t know what is,” concluded young
Simpson, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Where does she live?” asked Jack, in a tone of great
excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s down here somewhere,” answered Frank, looking
over the article. “Here it is, No. &mdash;&mdash; Prescott Street,
Bronx.”</p>

<p>“Let me have the paper,” cried Jack, grabbing it eagerly.</p>

<p>He glanced over the article with feverish interest; then
he rushed into Mr. Bishop’s office and pointed it out to
that gentleman.</p>

<p>“I guess there’s no doubt but this woman is the person
who lost the very money that you picked up yesterday. The
amount, as well as other particulars, corresponds. Go
around to the Blank Trust Company and have them describe
the woman and the notes they paid her. The cashier
will probably have a memorandum of the banks that issued
the large notes, at any rate. If the list corresponds with
those in the envelope in the safe, you had better take the
package up to the address given in the ‘World,’ and if the
woman can describe the money with reasonable accuracy
and her description coincides with that furnished by the
trust company, you will be pretty safe in restoring to her
the sum she lost. I am very glad, for the poor woman’s
sake, that you were the one who found her money.”</p>

<p>Jack followed the manager’s suggestions, and the result
was that they were both satisfied they had located the rightful
owner of the $6,700.</p>

<p>“Start right up there now, Jack, and get back as soon
as you can,” said Mr. Bishop. “The cashier will hand
you the carfare.”</p>

<p>It was something over an hour before Jack reached the
address printed by the ‘World’&mdash;a small, two-story, frame
building, one of a row of six, on a side street off Westchester
Avenue.</p>

<p>He rang the bell and a boy answered, holding the door
partly ajar.</p>

<p>“I should like to see Mrs. Breeze,” said Jack, in a business-like
way.</p>

<p>“Are you a reporter?” asked the boy, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly,” grinned the young messenger. “I’m
from Wall Street.”</p>

<p>“Who are you talking to, Bobbie?” asked a woman’s voice
rather petulantly.</p>

<p>“There’s a boy here from Wall Street who says he wants
to see you,” answered the young hopeful.</p>

<p>“What does he want?”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” repeated the lad.</p>

<p>“I want to see Mrs. Breeze in reference to the money she
lost.”</p>

<p>“Let him come in,” and Jack was admitted.</p>

<p>A sad-faced woman of fifty, with her eyes swollen from
weeping, made her appearance from a back room.</p>

<p>“Has any trace been found of my money?” asked the
woman, with suppressed eagerness.</p>

<p>“If you will describe the notes as well as you can remember
them, I will be able to answer you,” said Jack, who
saw that Mrs. Breeze’s personal description exactly corresponded
with that furnished by the trust company.</p>

<p>“The six one-thousand-dollar bills were new, but I didn’t
notice the name of the bank either on them or on the other
notes, one of which was a five-hundred-dollar and the other
two one-hundred. I had them in a large, oblong envelope.
That is all I can say about them.”</p>

<p>“I think you have described them correctly,” said Jack,
producing the envelope he had picked up. “Is this your
property?”</p>

<p>The woman pounced on the envelope like a hawk, opened
the flap, took out the money and counted it with eager
eyes; then, satisfied that it was all there, restored to her
in the most wonderful manner after she had given it up
for lost, she sank back in her chair and began to cry convulsively.</p>

<p>After a moment or two she recovered her composure and
inquired of Jack how the money had been found.</p>

<p>He told her how he had picked it up close to the entrance
of the trust company.</p>

<p>She had drawn the money at two o’clock, and Jack had
found it close on to four.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that an envelope containing such
a large sum of money could have laid on the sidewalk of
a prominent thoroughfare like Wall Street, glanced at and
walked over by many people, and yet no one had had the
curiosity to pick it up.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Mrs. Breeze.</p>

<p>“Jack Hazard, madam.”</p>

<p>“You are an honest boy. I am sure you have a good
mother and that she is very proud of you. This money you
have returned to me is the savings of our entire life. I
don’t like to think what the result might have been if it
had been lost for good and all. As testimony of our gratitude
I want you to accept these two bills,” and she offered
Jack the two hundred-dollar notes.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” said the boy. “I couldn’t think of taking
so much money from you.”</p>

<p>“But you must, or you will take away half the pleasure
I feel at the recovery of my money. Really, it is a great
deal less than you really deserve. I insist that you accept
them,” said Mrs. Breeze firmly, forcing the bills into his
hand.</p>

<p>Jack saw she was intensely earnest in her demand, and
with some reluctance he put them in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I am very happy indeed that you have got your money
back,” he said as he rose to go.</p>

<p>“I feel like another woman to what I did before you came
here. Be sure I shall not soon forget the honest lad to
whom I am indebted for its recovery,” were her last words
as Jack ran down the steps after bidding her good-bye.</p>

<p class="h2sub">A DERELICT OF WALL STREET.</p>

<p>On his way back to the office Jack stopped at the Seaman’s
Bank, on the corner of Wall and Pearl Streets, and
opened a personal account for $150. The balance of the
$200 he had received from Mrs. Breeze he handed over to
his mother when he got home that night. You may be
sure there was great joy in that little household over this
unexpected windfall, and now the future looked very bright
for them indeed.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon Frank Simpson severed his connection
with Mr. Atherton’s office, and the two boys parted
in an especially cordial way.</p>

<p>Nothing of any moment occurred during the next three
or four months to interrupt the regular routine of Jack’s
duties.</p>

<p>He and his chum, Ed Potter, both had the Saturday half-holiday
during the summer, and they put it in mostly playing
ball up at the Olympic Field.</p>

<p>One day Jack learned that Hartz’s messenger was about
to leave him, so he called on the broker and asked him if
he would give his friend Potter a trial.</p>

<p>Hartz, who had a good opinion of Hazard, readily agreed
to oblige him, so next day Ed came down to Wall Street
and Jack introduced him to Hartz.</p>

<p>In a day or so, Potter was taken into Hartz’s office on
trial, and, proving satisfactory, was told that he would be
advanced, if he deserved it, when the opportunity presented
itself.</p>

<p>Everybody who ran across Jack Hazard liked him.</p>

<p>This was especially true in respect to those in the office
with whom the boy came into daily contact.</p>

<p>From Mr. Atherton himself down to the least important
clerk it was all the same.</p>

<p>It is possible, if there was any choice in that matter, Jack
liked Millie Price, the stenographer and typewriter better
than anyone else.</p>

<p>Most everyone said she was a pretty girl, and what everybody
generally says goes.</p>

<p>She was certainly attractive in her manners, vivacious
in her talk, and generally polite and agreeable in her deportment.</p>

<p>She was a smart worker, was well up in her business, and
had the confidence of the firm.</p>

<p>“She has a level head and doesn’t put on any airs,” said
Jack to his friend Ed one day when he was speaking about
her.</p>

<p>“I s’pose she gets good pay,” remarked Potter.</p>

<p>“I believe she gets twelve dollars. She lives in Brooklyn
with her mother, who is a widow, and I guess all the money
they have is what she makes.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t the only girl that supports her home.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” nodded Jack, and then they began to talk
of something else.</p>

<p>Next day Jack happened to be over at Hartz’s office on
business for his firm when a seedy-looking old man, with
a dissipated and dejected aspect, shuffled into the place.</p>

<p>“I want to see Mr. Hartz,” he said in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hartz is engaged,” replied the clerk, turning away.</p>

<p>Just then Hartz came out of his private room, and the
visitor motioned to him in an eager sort of way.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the broker, coldly, as he stepped up to the
railing, “your account is closed, Mr. Tuggs. We sent you
a notice and, as you didn’t respond, had to close you out at
twenty-two, with a balance against you. Jenkins,” addressing
his head bookkeeper, “prepare a statement of Mr.
Tuggs’ account and hand it to me with notice of sale. Sit
down, Mr. Tuggs. Statement ready presently,” and Mr.
Hartz re-entered his sanctum, while the customer, with a
gesture of despair, tottered over to the indicator and examined
it with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>Jack had overheard it all, and he watched this old derelict
of Wall Street with sympathetic eyes.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” he inquired of the clerk who had brought
him the envelope he was to take back to Atherton’s.</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean? Oh, Tuggs?” and the dapper
clerk laughed sneeringly. “He’s got to be a regular
nuisance round here, and we’re trying to get rid of him.
He was rich once&mdash;a retired manufacturer, I think, who
caught the Wall Street fever. Hartz has always been his
broker, and I guess has sheared him down to his last dollar.
At any rate, he used to shovel the dough in at a comfortable
rate, but somehow or another he was nearly always on
the wrong side of the market, and of late his investments
haven’t amounted to shucks. Besides, he’s taken to drinking
and has grown so disreputable in his looks that the
boss doesn’t care to have him around any more. This last
deal of his was two hundred shares of Lebanon and Jericho,
which he bought on a ten-per-cent margin, as usual, for a
rise, and I guess it took his last dollar. It’s fair stock, but
fluctuates a good deal. After he bought it, it went to
thirty-six, when he should have sold out. But he didn’t;
expected it would go higher, of course, like all the lambs.
Then it began to drop, and ever since it’s been below thirty-two
he’s been on the anxious seat,” with a grin. “He’d
drop in a dozen times a day and ask questions about it.
He gave us all a pain; so I guess Hartz thought it was time
to choke him off.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t close him out unless the stock went down
ten per cent,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied the clerk; “but it got pretty
close to the danger mark day before yesterday, and we sent
him a demand for more margin.”</p>

<p>“And he couldn’t produce?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t. Just before the Exchange closed Lebanon
and Jericho touched twenty-two.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Hartz sold him out?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Hartz had something else to do than thinking
about that measley little transaction.”</p>

<p>“But I heard him tell the man he had closed him out at
twenty-two,” persisted Jack.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the clerk, with a wink, “there are more ways
than one of killing a cat. The boss saw a chance of getting
rid of an undesirable customer when he noted that the
stock had touched twenty-two, though the last quotation,
a few minutes later, was twenty-four and three-eighths. He
simply made an arrangement this morning with another
broker and told Jenkins to make an entry of the transaction
as having occurred yesterday and to report him closed out
at twenty-two&mdash;see? That’s done every day,” nodding good-bye
to Jack.</p>

<p>The boy understood, and his lip curled at the meanness
of the transaction, for the steal was small.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Jack knew that most reputable brokers,
in a case where a man had been a good customer of the
house, would sooner have strained a point in his favor than
have worked the squeeze game against him.</p>

<p>But Hartz wasn’t accustomed to do business in that way.</p>

<p>“I’m dead sorry for the poor old fellow,” murmured
Jack, turning to leave, just as Jenkins came over and thrust
the statement into Tuggs’ trembling fingers.</p>

<p>The old fellow looked at it blankly.</p>

<p>“I believe it’s all a lie,” he said, hoarsely. “I don’t believe
Hartz has sold my stock at all. It touched twenty-two, and
he reports it sold at the lowest price, though it rose immediately
to twenty-four and three-eighths. They credit it
on my account at twenty-two, and it is now thirty, and they
steal a profit to themselves of over eight hundred dollars,
and cast me out a beggar. It closed at twenty-two and
three-eighths, and opened at twenty-two and five-eighths.
It is infamous! But what can I do? I am ruined. I am
helpless. I am utterly at the mercy of this man. He is
rich with the money he has taken from fools like me, and
yet he will not help me.”</p>

<p>Jack listened to his ravings in silent pity and held the
door open for him to totter out.</p>

<p>Later in the day, just after the Exchange had closed,
Jack ran across Tuggs again on Wall Street, coming out
of an office building with a bundle in his hand.</p>

<p>He looked more despairing than ever, if that could be
possible.</p>

<p>He stood for several minutes, looking up and down the
thoroughfare as if not knowing which way to go.</p>

<p>Then he started across the street, staggering like a
drunken man, just as an express wagon came swinging along
at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>Jack sprang forward just in the nick of time to save
him from being trampled on by the horses.</p>

<p>“Where in thunder are you going to?” the driver yelled
at him in an angry tone.</p>

<p>Tuggs took no notice of the remark.</p>

<p>Indeed he seemed hardly conscious that he had just escaped
a grave peril.</p>

<p>He stood swaying to and fro in Jack’s grasp like some
scarecrow that had come from a cornfield.</p>

<p>“Let me help you across,” said the boy.</p>

<p>Tuggs looked at him with lack-lustre eyes and stepped
out as Jack pulled him along by the arm.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Jack, after he had landed
him on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Tuggs, wearily.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d better go home, hadn’t you?” suggested
the young messenger.</p>

<p>“Home?” muttered the old man, in an absent kind of
way.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” asked Jack, curiously.</p>

<p>The boy had to repeat the question before he learned that
Tuggs was stopping at the Mills House&mdash;that haven for
derelicts of all ages and conditions.</p>

<p>“Gee!” thought the young messenger, “if he was a retired
manufacturer once, he’s sunk pretty low. I guess Wall
Street has much to answer for.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">JACK’S FIRST INVESTMENT.</p>

<p>The old man dropped his package on the sidewalk, and
the string becoming undone the contents were spilled out.</p>

<p>Jack stooped down to pick them up and found they were
certificates of some kind of mining stock he had never
heard of.</p>

<p>Each one represented 500 shares of the Gopher Gold Mining
Company, of Bullfrog, Nevada.</p>

<p>At the sight of them Tuggs seemed to brighten up a bit.</p>

<p>“Do you want to buy them?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“What are they worth?” asked Jack, smiling at the idea
of a messenger boy being able to acquire even 500 shares
of any reputable mining stock.</p>

<p>“Millions!” exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” thought the boy. “He’s crazy, sure.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you sell them to somebody that’s got the
money to pay for them. You look as if you needed the
cash,” said Jack, aloud.</p>

<p>“Nobody will buy them,” replied Tuggs, sadly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“They can’t have a market value, then.”</p>

<p>“The company says they’re worth ten cents a share. I
paid three cents for them more than a year ago.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the company’ll buy them in, then,” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Their office is in Denver.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you write to the company?”</p>

<p>“I want some money now&mdash;to-day. I haven’t a cent to
pay my room rent or get something to eat,” wailed the old
man.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a half a dollar for you; that’ll see you
through till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You’re very kind. I’m afraid I sha’n’t live long. I’d
like to sell you this stock cheap. There’s five thousand
shares, and you can have it for a hundred dollars, or even
fifty, if you haven’t so much as that. Some day it will be
valuable. It’s selling for ten cents a share to-day; that
makes the shares worth five hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t buy them,” said Jack, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity,” mumbled Tuggs. “You’re losing the
chance of your life.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do for you. Come up to
our office and leave the certificates. I’ll give you a receipt
for them. Then I’ll ask our manager what he thinks they’re
worth as a speculation. He knows a good deal about Western
mines. If they’re worth anything, perhaps the firm
will take them off your hands or I can get somebody to buy
them.”</p>

<p>Just then Jack spied Oliver Bird coming out of his office.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” he said. “Maybe I can find out about
them now. Here’s a broker I’m acquainted with. I’ll let
him see them.”</p>

<p>So the messenger boy darted up to Mr. Bird, who was
glad to see him and shook him cordially by the hand.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d tell me, Mr. Bird, if this stock is worth
anything,” said Jack.</p>

<p>The broker took the certificates and glanced at them.</p>

<p>“One of those wild-cat mines advertised in the daily press
to catch fools,” said the gentleman, handing them back.</p>

<p>“Then you wouldn’t advise me to invest fifty dollars in
these five thousand shares?”</p>

<p>“Hardly, Jack. Still, fifty dollars isn’t much to risk,
and it is always possible for one of these mines, which are
floated on the reputation of rich ore leads in their neighborhood,
to turn up a winner. If you can get these shares for
fifty dollars and can afford to invest that amount on a
one-hundred-to-one shot, as I should call it, why, it’s better
than many investments I know of.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. They belong to that old man yonder,
who has been ruined on the market. He was rich once, but
he caught the Street fever, and Hartz, on Exchange Place,
has been his doctor&mdash;I should say, broker,” grinned the boy.</p>

<p>Bird’s face clouded at the mention of Hartz’s name.</p>

<p>“Hartz is one of the slickest men on the Street,” said
Mr. Bird, “and one of the hardest, too, as I know to my
cost. There isn’t a particle of mercy in his make-up. He’s
ruined half a dozen brokers, to my certain knowledge. If
it hadn’t been that my rash attempt on my life that morning
frightened him into making a certain concession, I should
have been down and out. As it is, he didn’t lose anything,
and I was able to weather the storm.”</p>

<p>“I have it from one of Hartz’s clerks that the old man
left all his money at their office. I should think he’d do
something for an old customer who had been so unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“Hartz isn’t built that way,” replied Oliver Bird.</p>

<p>“You don’t think Hartz took an unfair advantage of
him right along, do you?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Now you’re treading on delicate ground, young man.
But I think I can answer your question this way: I dare
say he had as much show to win out at Hartz’s as at any
other broker’s. No speculator who monkeys with the stock
market has an even show for his money. It isn’t the
broker’s fault; it’s the game he’s up against. The outside
public make no money out of the brokers; the brokers live
on the outside public. You simply bet that a certain stock
will go up or down; generally it goes the way you don’t
expect, and there you are.”</p>

<p>“Or you hold on too long,” suggested the boy, who
thought he knew why most of the uninitiated dropped their
wealth.</p>

<p>“Of course; but who can guess the right moment to unload,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Well, I feel sorry for the old man. It’s evident he’s
seen better days. I am thinking of taking this stock on the
bare chance it may turn out to be worth something one of
these days.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s your lookout, Jack. I don’t advise you to
buy it; but if you want to take a flyer of that kind, the
experience will probably be worth the price to you. Good-bye.
Come up and see us soon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I will. Good afternoon, Mr. Bird.”</p>

<p>Then Jack rejoined Tuggs, who during the interval
waited for him like a submissive animal at the command
of his master.</p>

<p>“Come with me; I’m going back to our office. I’ll put
your stock in the safe and give you a receipt for it. Come
down about noon to-morrow, and I’ll give you fifty dollars
for it.”</p>

<p>Tuggs was satisfied, got his receipt, and left the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Next day Jack bought the stock in regular form.</p>

<p>When he told Mr. Bishop what he had done, that gentleman
rather frowned upon the transaction.</p>

<p>Finally he laughed, and told Jack to write to Denver,
enclosing the numbers of the certificates, and request the
secretary of the company to make the proper transfer on
the books of the company.</p>

<p>He did so at the first chance, and went home feeling like
a bloated capitalist on a limited scale.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">HOW JACK ACQUIRED INSIDE INFORMATION.</p>

<p>One morning Jack was sent to deliver a package of
important papers at the office of a well-known millionaire
capitalist.</p>

<p>Entering the reception-room, he found Hartz and another
prominent broker standing by one of the windows, talking
in a low tone together.</p>

<p>They did not notice him right away, and though the boy
made no effort to listen to their conversation, of which he
couldn’t hear much any way, a bit of valuable information
came to him quite unexpectedly that set him thinking very
hard as he marched inside to deliver his package to the
capitalist in the private office.</p>

<p>He had heard Hartz and the other broker talking about a
certain stock which they were going to corner.</p>

<p>They had called on the millionaire, expecting to interest
him in the scheme with others whose names were written
down on a list referred to by Hartz during his talk.</p>

<p>Now, many boys wouldn’t have given the matter a second
thought, or if they had, wouldn’t have had the gumption
to consider how they might avail themselves of the knowledge
that every broker in the district would have given his
head, so to speak, to have an inkling of.</p>

<p>But Jack Hazard was smarter than a steel trap.</p>

<p>Corners and such things were familiar terms to him.</p>

<p>He hadn’t burnt his fingers in the market as yet.</p>

<p>He was a deal too cautious for that.</p>

<p>But all the same, the fever had been working in his blood,
and there was no telling when it would break out.</p>

<p>He had his own idea about investing in stocks, and had
figured the thing out until his brain sometimes got weary
over the work.</p>

<p>Practically he was standing on the brink, like a timid
bather on the seashore, tempted by the sight of the water,
but hesitating to make the first plunge.</p>

<p>And now, like a sudden inspiration, he believed he saw
his way to a good thing.</p>

<p>And it was a good thing, if he only worked it right.</p>

<p>And he thought he knew how to do it.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking about?” asked Millie Price,
noticing the preoccupied air of the boy after he returned
from the capitalist’s office.</p>

<p>“I was thinking how I could make a haul,” said Jack,
with a grin of anticipation.</p>

<p>“Not in stocks, I hope,” said Millie, with some concern,
for she had little faith in Wall Street deals.</p>

<p>“That’s for me to know and you to find out, Millie,” said
Jack, tantalizingly.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you just horrid!” she retorted, with a smile that
showed the young messenger was a prime favorite of hers.</p>

<p>“I hope not. That’s what you said about that dude that
was in here yesterday. I hope you aren’t comparing me
with him.”</p>

<p>“The idea! Just as if I would!” she said, tossing her
head. “Oh, by the way; who do you suppose was in here
inquiring for you while you were out?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t guess, Millie, unless it was the Mayor, who is
a particular friend of mine,” said Jack, with a grin.</p>

<p>“What a ridiculous boy you are! It was Mr. Seymour
Atherton.”</p>

<p>“No; is that a fact?” said the boy, with evident interest.
“I should like to have seen him.”</p>

<p>“And he had your little mash with him, too,” said Millie,
with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>“What’s that? What are you getting off?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you really know who I mean?”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t. I haven’t any mash unless it’s yourself,”
grinned Jack.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got a cheek!” laughed the stenographer,
blushing. “Well, then, I’ll tell you who it was. It was
Fanny Bruce, and she looked just too cute for anything.”</p>

<p>“I’d liked to have seen her, too,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“She’s the loveliest little girl, I think, I ever saw,” said
Millie, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Ed Potter, walking in. “What are
you two chinning about? Why don’t you get busy? What
am I paying you for?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Ed! What brought you around?”</p>

<p>“My feet. Did you think it was an automobile?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he funny?” said Millie.</p>

<p>“You must excuse him, Millie; he isn’t responsible at all
times.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you think that’s amusing,” growled Ed.</p>

<p>“Say, Ed, I want to see you a moment,” said Jack, walking
over to a window.</p>

<p>“Well, look at me; I’m on exhibition for the time being,”
snickered Potter.</p>

<p>“Oh, rats! Come over here. I want to talk to you.
Got any money you want to invest?” he asked as Ed approached.</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;seven cents.”</p>

<p>“Stop your fooling. Got ten dollars? If you have, I’ll
put you on to a sure thing.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Buy a couple of shares of L. S. on a ten-per-cent margin.
Last quotation thirty-six.”</p>

<p>“Got a tip?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I have. I’m going down to the Seaman’s
to-morrow to draw my pile. I’ve enough to collar twenty-five
shares at that margin.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll think about it.”</p>

<p>Next morning L. S. opened at the same figure, and as
soon as he got the chance Jack hied himself to the savings
bank, drew his money, and, dropping in on Oliver Bird,
surprised that gentleman by asking him to buy 25 shares
of L. S. for him.</p>

<p>“You ought to know your business, Jack; but it seems to
me you’re doing a foolish thing,” said the broker, warningly.</p>

<p>“That’s where you and I differ at present. Back me for
twenty-five shares more, and I’ll let you in on the ground
floor.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” asked Bird, curiously.</p>

<p>“Will you stand for the twenty-five if I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if you’re determined to make the plunge;
but remember, I strongly advise you against it. I owe you
a good turn, and I’ll back you for fifty, so take your
money away.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t business, Mr. Bird. I won’t accept any favors
in this deal. I come to you same as I would to any broker.
I’ll sell you a share in my tip for a ten-per-cent margin
on twenty-five shares of L. S. And if you consider the tip
worth it, I want you to deal with me same as you would
with anyone else.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s your tip, Jack?” asked the broker, smiling
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Hartz and Bradshaw are getting up a corner to boost
L. S.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” asked Bird, sharply.</p>

<p>Jack told him what he had overheard the two men say at
the capitalist’s office the day before.</p>

<p>Mr. Bird considered a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind admitting that your information is valuable,
and I’m going to look into it. If I find from indications
that are bound to show themselves in a day or two
that a pool has apparently been formed, I’ll stake you for
one hundred shares; the tip is worth that easily.”</p>

<p>“All right! Much obliged,” said the boy, joyfully.
“That’s business, and my hundred dollars will give me
twenty-five shares more. But you must let me use my own
judgment about selling out.”</p>

<p>“You’d better let me attend to that, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Thanks; but I’ve got my own idea. I’d like to feel
independent in the matter. I’ve been studying the market
for some time, and if you can shear me of the little wool
I’ve got, you’re welcome to do so.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want to do that, Jack,” laughed the broker.</p>

<p>“And I don’t propose to give you the chance to do it,”
grinned the boy.</p>

<p>“You’re a case, young man. Drop in and see me in a
day or two.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.” And Jack took his leave, feeling that
at last he was getting to be of some importance in the
Street.</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE GREATEST SCARE OF HIS LIFE.</p>

<p>When the Exchange closed that afternoon L. S. was
quoted at 36⅛.</p>

<p>It opened at the same figure on the following morning,
and when business was over for the day Jack’s eager eyes
noticed that it had advanced only one-half a point.</p>

<p>Next day it opened at 37, and during the morning the
young speculator managed to drop in on Oliver Bird.</p>

<p>“Come inside,” said his friend, the broker. “I want to
see you.”</p>

<p>Jack hastened into the private den.</p>

<p>“Here is a memorandum for one hundred and twenty-five
shares of L. S. which I bought for your account at thirty-six
and a half, but I’ve made it thirty-six, as that was the
figure you ordered the stock at, and as I didn’t buy it till
yesterday I had to pay the fraction extra. I’ll hold the
stock subject to your order, of course. I’m satisfied that
a corner has been formed to bull the stock, and that it
will go up to some purpose in a day or two. I stand to
win something handsome myself on this deal, and when
I’ve cashed in, I’m going to treat you to a Sherry blow-out.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you’ll make a good thing out of it, Mr.
Bird, for you’ve put me in the way of becoming a small
capitalist myself.”</p>

<p>“You don’t owe me any thanks; it’s all the other way.
But recollect you’ve assumed the responsibility of your own
deal. I only hope you won’t make a wrong move. After
the stock will have reached a certain figure&mdash;and what that
will be no man can guess&mdash;the bottom is liable to drop out
at any moment. Should you be caught on the toboggan,
your profits will vanish like smoke.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I understand that. But I’m out for experience,
and I’m banking that it’ll be on the right side.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, I admire your nerve; but while you have
the advantage of inside information at the start, your lack
of experience on the market may land you in the soup
when you least expect it.”</p>

<p>In spite of his natural assurance, Jack’s nerves were all
of a tingle during the next ten days as he followed the rising
quotations of L. S. from 36½ to 76, the closing figure when
the Exchange shut down on the tenth day.</p>

<p>Several times he had actually been on the point of ordering
the big broker to sell him out, but he hesitated at the
golden prospect of a higher market.</p>

<p>“With a syndicate probably backed by millions behind
it, it will surely go to par,” he reasoned with boyish enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He was assailed by the same fatal temptation that has
ruined thousands on the very brink of a successful coup.</p>

<p>Twice Jack had received a hint from Mr. Bird&mdash;the
last a strong one. He considered them and then decided
to hold on a while longer.</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, what’s the matter with you; you’re as nervous
as an old woman,” said Ed as they were on their way
home on the afternoon of the day the stock touched 76.</p>

<p>“Am I?” returned the lad, with a queer sort of laugh.
“I didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p>“Sure you are. What’s up? You aren’t thinking of
running off with Millie Price and getting married, are
you?” jokingly.</p>

<p>“Hardly, old man.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t been robbing the office safe with a view of emigrating
to Canada?”</p>

<p>“Not much chance for that,” with what was intended to
be a cheerful grin.</p>

<p>“Then what’s troubling you?”</p>

<p>“Is my hair turning gray?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t noticed that it is,” said Potter, in some surprise.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but that it was, you seemed so concerned
about me.”</p>

<p>“Stop your jollying. You’re different to what you were
a week ago, and that’s enough to show that you’ve got something
on your mind. Ain’t I your friend?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then you oughtn’t to keep me in the dark.”</p>

<p>“I won’t&mdash;after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why not now?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ve particular reasons.”</p>

<p>Ed was by no means satisfied with this answer, but he
had to let it go at that.</p>

<p>Jack’s mother and sister had also noticed and remarked
on the change that had come over him, but to all their
anxious inquiries he refused to admit that there was anything
the matter with him.</p>

<p>That evening he spent studying the market quotations
for the past week and figuring upon the chances of L. S.
going higher.</p>

<p>Finally the big broker’s warning that at any moment he
might expect to be lost in the shuffle if he tempted fortune
too far decided his course of action for the next day.</p>

<p>“I’ll order Mr. Bird to sell first thing in the morning,”
he said to himself.</p>

<p>Once he had reached a decision, the matter was settled
for good and all.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that fact, his dreams that night were
enough to set his hair on end.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was perfectly cool and collected next
morning when he reached the office and exchanged the usual
greetings with Millie Price.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen you look so much like a little man of
business as you do to-day, Jack,” laughed Millie.</p>

<p>“And I’ve never seen you look half so pretty as you do
this morning,” responded the lad, gallantly.</p>

<p>Millie blushed to the eyes.</p>

<p>“Really, you’re too complimentary for anything,” she
said as she busied herself with her machine.</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>“Will you do me a favor?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I should be delighted,” she replied. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Put a fresh sheet of paper on your machine. I want
you to write a note for me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. There; now I’m ready for you to dictate.”</p>

<p>“All right. Got the date down?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then here goes: ‘Mr. Oliver Bird,&mdash;Wall Street.
Dear Sir&mdash;Please close out my L. S. stock&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Your what?” almost gasped Millie, stopping the machine.</p>

<p>“Please don’t interrupt me, Miss Price,” said Jack, with
a sober countenance, while the girl stared at him with all
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Jack. “Stock, I think, was the last word.
‘Stock at the ruling quotation at once, and oblige yours
very truly.’ That’ll do. I’ll sign it while you are addressing
the envelope.”</p>

<p>“Is this one of your jokes, Jack?” asked Millie, handing
him the envelope.</p>

<p>“I’m not in the habit of joking in matters of business,”
replied Jack, with a serio-comic expression.</p>

<p>“Then you really are dabbling in stocks, which you ought
not to do,” said Millie, severely.</p>

<p>“Do you take me for a kid, Miss Price?” asked the boy,
trying hard to suppress a grin.</p>

<p>“‘Miss Price’! Come&mdash;I like that!” she exclaimed,
flashing a half-reproachful glance at him.</p>

<p>“I was only teasing you, Millie. Yes; I have been fooling
a bit with the market. Eleven days ago I bought on the
usual ten-per-cent margin one hundred and twenty-five
shares of L. S. at thirty-six. I am going to sell out at
once.”</p>

<p>Millie grabbed up that morning’s “Wall Street Indicator”
and ran her eyes down the list of stock quotations.</p>

<p>“Here it is: L. S. closing price, seventy-six. Jack Hazard!
You don’t mean to say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The girl stopped through sheer amazement.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to say what?” laughed Jack.</p>

<p>“That you have one hundred and twenty-five shares.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I have.”</p>

<p>“And you bought in at thirty-six?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I did.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s a profit of five thousand dollars, you reckless
boy!” gasped Millie, after a rapid mental calculation.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I figured it&mdash;if the price doesn’t break
before my broker can sell it this morning.”</p>

<p>“Well!”</p>

<p>That’s all she said, for just then Mr. Bishop came in;
but the exclamation spoke volumes.</p>

<p>“I should like to go out five minutes on a little matter
of business, Mr. Bishop,” said Jack, and on receiving the
desired permission, he rushed down to Bird’s office and
handed in the envelope, which he had marked “Important.”</p>

<p>It was half-past ten when the young messenger returned
to the office from his first errand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bishop wants you,” said the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>The manager was dictating to Millie.</p>

<p>“Take this note&mdash;&mdash;” began Mr. Bishop to Jack.</p>

<p>“Mr. Warren wishes to see you, sir,” interrupted a clerk
at that juncture.</p>

<p>“Tell him to step right in.”</p>

<p>Mr. Warren, one of the firm’s largest customers, walked
into the private office hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Say, Bishop, I just got out in time, didn’t I? L. S.
has gone to pieces, and the Exchange is in a panic.”</p>

<p>Millie, with a startled look, glanced at Jack.</p>

<p>The boy had turned as white as a ghost.</p>

<p>“You’re wanted at the ’phone, Hazard,” said another
clerk, poking his head inside the sanctum.</p>

<p>“May I&mdash;&mdash;” began the boy, in a shaky voice.</p>

<p>“Certainly; answer it,” said the manager, without looking
up.</p>

<p>“Poor boy,” murmured Millie as Jack almost staggered
out of the private office. “I feel so sorry for him,” and
she looked as if she wanted to cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with your messenger?” asked Mr.
Warren.</p>

<p>“Nothing that I know of,” replied Mr. Bishop, in surprise.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why, he looked as if he was going to faint just now.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t observe it; maybe he’s sick. He didn’t say
anything about feeling bad. So the bottom has fallen out of
L. S., eh?”</p>

<p>In the meantime Jack reached the ’phone and grasped
the receiver in a mechanical way.</p>

<p>“Well?” he shouted, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“That you, Jack?”</p>

<p>“That you, Mr. Bird?”</p>

<p>“Yes. L. S. is on the slump, and no telling where it
will fetch up; but you’re safe, young man. Your order
to sell came in the very nick of time. I disposed of your
stock at seventy-six, the top figure, and I had hardly recorded
the transaction before Yates, a big gun, dumped ten
thousand shares on the market. Hartz couldn’t handle it,
and pandemonium has resulted. I congratulate you. You
had the closest kind of a call. See you later. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” muttered Jack as he hung up the receiver,
barely repressing a whoop of delight. “I’ve scooped the
trick! And to think that a minute ago I was nearly frightened
out of my boots!”</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE DUDE AND THE VIOLETS.</p>

<p>Jack hustled on his next errand as if the wings of Mercury
were attached to his ankles.</p>

<p>He was fairly tickled to death over the coup he had made
on the market.</p>

<p>Five thousand dollars!</p>

<p>It kept ringing in his ears and marked time to his nimble
footsteps.</p>

<p>And it was pleasant music, too, you may well believe.</p>

<p>When he got back, the first thing he did was to tell of
his good luck to Millie.</p>

<p>And wasn’t she glad?</p>

<p>Well, don’t say a word!</p>

<p>She had been fearing the worst and sympathizing with
him in her mind, and after all it had been a false alarm.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with so much money?” she
asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided whether I’ll buy a farm or start a
bank,” replied Jack, with a happy grin.</p>

<p>“What a comparison!” laughed the pretty stenographer.</p>

<p>A little while afterward he told Mr. Bishop, and the
manager was amazed.</p>

<p>“You’re a lucky boy, Jack; but don’t try it again.”</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon he went around to Bird’s office.</p>

<p>The big broker was in and expecting a visit from him.</p>

<p>“It’s better to be born lucky than rich, young man,” he
said, genially. “Do you know, if you had allowed yourself
to get caught in that deal I should have been tempted to
have given you a dressing-down. As it was, you took altogether
too many chances. You only escaped by the skin
of your teeth. Why, I got rid of my holdings at sixty-nine
two days ago, and I was half tempted to sell you out at
the same time. Only, you see, that isn’t according to
Hoyle.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t treat me like a kid&mdash;for that is what
it would have amounted to if you had used your own judgment
against my orders.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad myself, seeing how the thing has turned out.
I’ll send you a statement and a certified check to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to deduct your regular commissions,” said
Jack, promptly.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied the broker, who understood the boy
thoroughly.</p>

<p>“I wish I was of age,” said Jack, wistfully.</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because then I could sign checks and not have to draw
my money personally whenever I wanted to use it. It would
save me lots of time.”</p>

<p>“I hope you aren’t thinking of making a practice of this
sort of thing. If you are, you’ll make a mistake. The best
thing that could happen to people who come into Wall
Street is to lose their first deal. It might serve to scare
them off for good.”</p>

<p>“Your advice is good, Mr. Bird, and I am much obliged
to you for it; but if I see another good thing going to
waste I should feel sorry to let it get away from me.”</p>

<p>“Good things are not handed out to the public, Jack.
You came by the L.&nbsp;S. tip through sheer horse luck&mdash;a
chance in a million.”</p>

<p>Jack made no answer to that, but took his leave soon,
after promising to dine with Mr. Bird the next evening at
Sherry’s.</p>

<p>On the way back to the office our young messenger boy
bought a nice bunch of violets, which he artfully attached
to Millie’s Remington while she was taking down the final
dictation of the day in Mr. Atherton’s room.</p>

<p>“Where did these come from?” she asked Jack, who was
perched over in the corner, reading a copy of that week’s
“Financial Chronicle,” as she reseated herself at the machine.</p>

<p>The sly puss knew pretty well who had bought them, but
that was one of her little coquetries.</p>

<p>“I think it was that dude that was in here the other day
that brought them expressly for you. He works upstairs,
you know,” replied Jack, smothering a grin.</p>

<p>Before she could reply, in walked that self-same dude,
Percy Chamberlain, with a duplicate bunch of violets.</p>

<p>And straightway he pranced up to Millie and held out
the flowers, with a low bow.</p>

<p>“Will you accept these flowers, Miss Price? Bought them
expressly for you, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>Millie was astonished.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, George Augustus Fitzwilliam!” exclaimed
Jack, dropping the paper and gliding over to the dude clerk,
whose left hand he seized and shook as if he were some long-lost
friend. “We haven’t seen you for two whole days.
Where have you been keeping yourself?”</p>

<p>Percy, who was a tall, thin, good-looking Englishman, one
of the clerks of the British &amp; North American Fire Insurance
Company, with offices on the third floor of the building,
gave a howl of pain and then hopped about the floor
like a monkey on a hot stove.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, fellow, squeezing my&mdash;aw&mdash;hand in
this mannah? Don’t you know any bettah?”</p>

<p>Percy was very angry indeed.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do? Give you one of those
pumphandle shakes? That isn’t my style, George Augustus,”
snickered Jack.</p>

<p>“I wish you would keep your distance, boy,” said Percy,
resentfully. “I don’t wish to be bothered by you, don’t you
know. You’re only the office boy. Really, Miss Price,” he
said stooping to pick up the violets he had dropped, “these
American boys are deuced annoying, don’t you know. These
flowers are for you. Hot-house specials, from Hutchins’,”
mentioning a prominent florist on Broadway.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Jack, who had been watching his
chance to chip in again, “I’m sorry to call you a liar,
George Augustus, but you bought ’em off that dago down
stairs. That’s where these came from, and if there’s any
difference between ’em I’d like you to point it out. Same
trade-mark on each,” and he pointed to the bit of red cord
with which each bunch was secured.</p>

<p>“One bunch is quite enough for me,” said Millie, with
a laugh. “If you’d come first, Mr. Chamberlain, why, I
might have accepted yours.”</p>

<p>“Really&mdash;&mdash;” began Percy.</p>

<p>“Come, George Augustus, you’d better sneak. Miss Price
has several letters to copy, and she wants to get home some
time this afternoon, don’t you know,” mimicking the Englishman.</p>

<p>“Won’t you accept them, Miss Price,” persisted Percy,
after an indignant look at Hazard.</p>

<p>“You will have to excuse me, Mr. Chamberlain,” said
Millie, turning to her machine and commencing to click
off her notes, thereby ignoring the dudish visitor.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, George Augustus,” cried Jack, as the disappointed
Englishman started slowly for the door. “Come in
again when you haven’t so long to stay.”</p>

<p>“You’re an insulting fellow. I don’t wish you to notice
me again,” angrily retorted the insurance clerk just as he
was passing out of the doorway.</p>

<p>“It was very kind of you to bring me those violets,” said
Millie to Jack as the door closed. “It’s my favorite flower.”</p>

<p>“You see, I’m getting reckless now; I’ve money to burn,”
laughed the boy. “Next thing you know, I’ll be asking you
to marry me.”</p>

<p>“You silly boy!” exclaimed Millie, blushing furiously
as Jack ran away.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">SILAS HOCKINS, FROM AVALANCH, N. J.</p>

<p>A few days after that, as Jack was coming out of the
Post Office, he was stopped by a sun-burned, countrified-looking
man, who said:</p>

<p>“Waal, sonny, kin yeou tell me where Nassau Street is?”</p>

<p>“Sure; come right along with me and I’ll steer you into
it,” replied the boy, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>But before the countryman could take a step, a dark-featured
man, dressed in a checked suit, with a Brazilian
sunstone in a gaudy scarf, and a strong odor of the Tenderloin
about him, stepped up and, grasping the farmer by the
hand, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, how do you do, Silas Hockins? When did you
come to town?”</p>

<p>“Waal, naow, yeou seem tew know me, mister, but I’m
gosh-darned ef I kin place yeou fur a cent,” answered
Farmer Hockins, in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“Why, I was down in your neighborhood all last summer.
Avalanch, New Jersey, is where you live, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Waal, naow, I expect yeou’re right there, mister; but
I don’t recollect yeou, just the same.”</p>

<p>“My name is Bond&mdash;Steve Bond.”</p>

<p>Silas Hockins shook his head, while Jack Hazard, who
stood a few feet away, sized the other stranger up for a
confidence man.</p>

<p>He was certain of it a moment later when the farmer
said:</p>

<p>“Seems yeou’re the second one thet’s stopped me sence
I landed from the ferryboat. The other chap thought he
knowed me, too; but when he found out my name was Silas
Hockins and thet I lived in Avalanch, New Jersey, why, he
’pologized and went off. He thought I was Josh Whitcomb,
from Newark. Haw, haw, haw!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind that, Hockins,” said the man, with
a crafty smile. “We New Yorkers are mighty glad to meet
our friends from the country, and we always do the right
thing by ’em.”</p>

<p>“Waal, naow, yeou don’t say!”</p>

<p>“Say,” put in Jack at this point, “I’m waiting for you.
You want to find Nassau Street, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, young man; you can run along. I’ll take
charge of Mr. Hockins and show him all that’s to be seen.”</p>

<p>The New Jerseyman seemed undecided what to do, seeing
which, Jack decided to block the sharper’s game.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, in a low voice; “I’m dead on to you.
There’s a cop across the street. If you don’t take a glide,
I’ll run over and give him the tip-off.”</p>

<p>The sharper saw that his game was up.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t forget you, young man, if I ever come across
you again,” he said, angrily, as he turned and walked away
without another word to the countryman.</p>

<p>“I reckon he don’t know me arter all,” remarked Mr.
Hockins, taking a fresh hold on his carpetbag as the man
from the Tenderloin faded around the corner of the Post
Office. “Still, he seemed to hev my name and whar I cum
from right pat.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t know you at all. That fellow was a confidence
man.” And as Silas Hockins followed across the
street into Ann Street, the boy explained the old threadbare
game to him.</p>

<p>“Waal, naow, yeou’re right smart, I reckon, to see
through thet chap at once. I s’pose yeou drink, don’t yeou?
A glass of cider would kinder hit me in the right place,”
and Hockins paused in front of a saloon.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for you, if you don’t linger too long,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p>“Ain’t yeou comin’ in?”</p>

<p>The boy shook his head.</p>

<p>“Waal, I won’t be more’n a minit.”</p>

<p>Jack glanced over a cheap lot of books on a vendor’s cart
drawn up alongside the narrow walk until Silas Hockins
reappeared.</p>

<p>“This is Nassau Street,” said Jack, after they had walked
a short block. “Where did you want to go?”</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ll tell yeou. I want tew get tew Wall Street,
and Dominie Hudson, of our town, told me ef I found
Nassau Street I could walk right into it.”</p>

<p>“He told you right. Come along; I’ll take you there.”</p>

<p>“Be yeou goin’ thet way, then?”</p>

<p>“Sure; that’s where I work.”</p>

<p>“Sho! Yeou don’t say! Maybe yeou kin tell me where
I kin find some of them thar bulls and bears what folks talk
about.”</p>

<p>“You want to visit the Stock Exchange. I’ll get you
an admission ticket from my boss.”</p>

<p>“Will yeou? That’s kind of yeou.”</p>

<p>“Where do you expect to stop while you’re in town?”
asked Jack, thinking he might direct Mr. Hockins to a cheap
but respectable hotel.</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ll tell yeou. I’m goin’ over to Brooklyn to
try and hunt up a niece of mine I hain’t seen sense she was
married, nigh on to twenty year ago. Her name was Sarah
Dusenbury, but she married a Price. She’s got a grown-up
darter thet works one of them highfalutin writin’ machines
like this,” and Mr. Hockins dropped his bag and proceeded
to give a comical illustration of how one clicks the keys of
a typewriter.</p>

<p>“Her name isn’t Millie Price, is it?” exclaimed Jack,
with some interest.</p>

<p>“Why, haow did yeou guess thet? Thet’s the gal’s name,
sure.”</p>

<p>“Would you know her if you saw her?”</p>

<p>“Waal, no, seein’ ez I hain’t never seen her in my life.
She’s a good gal, I’ve heerd, and I’ve concluded to do somethin’
fer her and her mother. I’ve saved a leetle somethin’
sence I took ter farmin’, an’ ez I hain’t got no one but
my niece to leave it to, I’ve come on tew hunt her up.”</p>

<p>“You’d better come to the office with me. Our stenographer
is named Millie Price, and perhaps she’s your relative.”</p>

<p>“Waal, it won’t dew no harm tew see the gal. She kin
tell ef her ma’s name is Sarah Dusenbury Price and ef she
wuz born daown East in the same taown I hailed from, and
sich like.”</p>

<p>So Jack piloted Silas Hockins into Atherton’s office.</p>

<p>Then he rushed up to Millie.</p>

<p>“Was your mother’s name Sarah Dusenbury before she
married Mr. Price?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the girl, opening her eyes very wide indeed.
“How did you come to find that out, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I met a relative of yours, Silas Hockins, and brought
him here. He’s in the reception-room. He wants to find
where you live. Hadn’t you better see him?”</p>

<p>“I’ve often heard mother speak of her uncle Silas, but
I’ve never seen him nor has he ever seen me.”</p>

<p>“Well, Millie, I think he’s a good thing to freeze to, as
he told me he has money and calculates on doing the right
thing by you and your mother. If I were you, I’d steer
him right over to your home. Mr. Bishop will let you off,
I guess. Go out and see him now. And don’t ever say I
didn’t do you a good turn.”</p>

<p>Millie had no trouble in identifying herself to Mr. Hockins’
satisfaction.</p>

<p>She got leave of absence for the rest of the afternoon, and
took Silas home with her.</p>

<p>As Jack had figured, Mr. Hockins’ arrival proved a good
thing in the end for both Mrs. Price and her daughter
Millie.</p>

<p class="h2sub">A POINTER&mdash;WORTH WHAT?</p>

<p>“I wish I had half your luck, Jack,” said Ed one morning
shortly after the young messenger had scooped in that
$5,000 on L. S. stock.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are referring to what I made the other
day.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I can’t see how you did it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised. I gave you the tip to buy as many
shares as you could put up the margin for. Did you do it?
No; you were afraid to risk even a ten-dollar note on a
good thing. Well, you lost your chance.”</p>

<p>“I lost more than that,” said Ed, with a mournful look.</p>

<p>“What did you lose?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen plunks.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well, after you told me you had collared five thousand
dollars on L. S. I went home and kicked myself around the
block.”</p>

<p>“That was right. You deserved it. If you’d only bought
two shares of L. S. as I told you to at first, you might have
made seventy-five dollars clear profit.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said to myself. I felt I’d been a chump.
You made a bunch of easy money while I hadn’t made a
sou. Well, along came Denny McFadden, and I told him
what a calf I’d been. He asked me if I had any money.
I told him I had fifteen dollars. Then he offered to put me
next to something that beat stocks all hollow. I knew what
he meant, and fought shy. But he talked me into going
around to a certain pool-room with him, just to see how
the thing was worked.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t go any further, Ed,” said Jack. “I know
what you’re going to say. Denny got you to wager your
fifteen dollars on some horse before you left. Isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I put the whole thing on Custard Pie, a long shot,
one hundred to one. Denny said he had a tip that the nag
was slated to win next day. He’d been over at the track
and claimed he knew all about it. It was the same as picking
up the money, and when I got the fifteen hundred I was
to give him five hundred for the tip.”</p>

<p>“Ed, you’re easy. I thought you knew what Denny is
by this time. As for racing, don’t you know that race-tracks
are open gambling-places, maintained in defiance of
the State Constitution because of a law passed corruptly?”</p>

<p>“I know pool-rooms are maintained in defiance of the
law, but at the tracks you can bet all you want. I don’t
see why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to argue the matter, Ed. I’m interested
in the stock market, not in the race-track. Now, I’ll tell
you what I’ll do for you the next time I catch on to a good
thing: I’ll put up twenty-five dollars for you in connection
with my own venture. That’ll give you a small stake if I
win.”</p>

<p>“If you do that, Jack, you’re a brick,” said Ed, brightening
up.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, all right.” And there the matter dropped for
the time being.</p>

<p>In spite of the well-meant advice of Oliver Bird and Mr.
Bishop, Jack was itching another crack at the market.</p>

<p>All the same, it wasn’t his idea to go at the thing blindfolded.</p>

<p>He hardly expected to pick up another tip like the last.</p>

<p>Still, he kept his eyes and ears wide open, so that in
case anything worth while drifted his way it wouldn’t get
by him.</p>

<p>Any small favor would be thankfully received.</p>

<p>He was on speaking terms with a good many brokers, and
he knew every prominent one by sight.</p>

<p>Next day Jack was coming along New Street about lunch
hour, when he ran into Hartz, the Exchange Place broker.</p>

<p>Hartz was a little, wiry man, with snappy black eyes, and
was about as shrewd as you find them down in the financial
district.</p>

<p>Ever since the day Jack saved Oliver Bird from taking
his own life in the office of the broker, Hartz had taken
more or less notice of the boy, which was something unusual
for him to do.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, he gave Ed Potter a job entirely
on Jack’s recommendation.</p>

<p>“Hello, young man! Who are you running into?” exclaimed
the broker, grabbing the boy with both his arms
and holding him tight.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Hartz, but I didn’t see you.”</p>

<p>“No; I’m not quite as big as Bird,” grinned Hartz.
“How long have you been on the Street now, Hazard?”</p>

<p>“Six months, sir.”</p>

<p>“Look as if you’d cut your eye teeth by this time. It’s
a wonder you don’t get into trouble with that tongue of
yours.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Jack, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yesterday morning, when you came into my office, young
Percy Chamberlain, secretary for the resident manager of
the British and North American Fire Insurance Company,
was there talking to Miss Kitson, my stenographer. Just
as you stepped up to her desk he remarked that he was the
last remaining member of his family, whereupon you said
you read in the morning paper that the lobster was becoming
extinct. And I suppose you wondered why Chamberlain
left the office in a huff. You’re a peach!”</p>

<p>Jack grinned.</p>

<p>“Percy makes me tired,” he said. “He’s always dropping
in and bothering our typewriter with his silly remarks, so
I make a point of giving a shot where I can.”</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in Hartz’s eye.</p>

<p>“Ever take a flyer on the market?” he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Once.”</p>

<p>“When was that?”</p>

<p>“Couple of weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“How did you come out?”</p>

<p>“Ahead.”</p>

<p>“Lucky boy.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you haven’t any tips to give away, have you,
Mr. Hartz?” grinned Jack. “You owe me one for saving
that carpet of yours the day Mr. Bird got reckless.”</p>

<p>“Don’t carry such things about with me,” said Hartz, in
his sharp, off-hand way. Then, after fixing the boy with
his penetrating eyes a moment, he suddenly said: “If you’ve
got twenty-five or fifty dollars you haven’t any use for, you
might buy a few shares of D. &amp; G. just to keep your
thoughts off Percy Chamberlain,” and the broker nodded
and walked away.</p>

<p>Jack looked after him.</p>

<p>“A few shares of D. &amp; G.,” he muttered. “I wonder
if he meant that? I noticed that stock went up a point
yesterday and two points so far to-day. Looks as if it was
a safe investment. I’d give something to find out if that
was the stock I saw him rushing about after this morning
on the floor of the Exchange? It isn’t like him, or any
other broker, for that matter, to give out a real, Simon-pure
pointer. It isn’t business. Still, I notice Hartz treats
me different from most people. Maybe he’s grateful because
I saved him from something like a scandal; at any rate, a
good many hard things would have been said about him if
Mr. Bird had killed himself up in his office that morning.
I’ll have to think this over. I guess it wouldn’t be fair
to tell anyone what he said about buying D. &amp; G. He kind
of sized me up pretty sharp before he opened his mouth
about it. I know he doesn’t like Chamberlain coming in
his office and taking up Miss Kitson’s time, and he was
tickled because I started the dude on the run. I’d like to
make another haul out of the market. Hartz hasn’t the least
idea I have $5,000 in bank. If he had, I guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack!” interrupted the voice of Ed Potter, and
his chum grasped him by the arm. “Let’s go in here and
have a bite.”</p>

<p>Jack allowed his friend to steer him into a crowded New
Street quick-lunch house.</p>

<p>They ordered coffee and stew as soon as a couple of stools
were vacated.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you haven’t the least idea whether or not your
boss is buying any D. &amp; G. stock, have you?” whispered
Jack.</p>

<p>Ed shook his head.</p>

<p>“You can’t learn much up in that place, I can tell you
that. I know Hartz did buy a block of some kind of stock
yesterday from a Mr. Warren, for I was sent over to get it.”</p>

<p>“You mean George Warren, of&mdash;Broad Street?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>Jack made a mental note.</p>

<p>“And I fetched another stack of stock this morning from
Bentley &amp; Clews.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what that was?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Say, Ed, s’pose we take in the Academy to-night,” said
Jack, suddenly changing the subject.</p>

<p>“I’m with you. What’s playing there?”</p>

<p>“‘In Old Japan.’ Well, so long. I’ll wait for you at
the house.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">IN THE GRASP OF THE MARKET.</p>

<p>“Mr. Atherton, do you know if Mr. George Warren has
any D. &amp; G. stock?” asked Jack of his employer that afternoon.</p>

<p>It was a rather cheeky thing for the boy to do, but then
he was something of a privileged character with the boss.</p>

<p>“I believe he has. At least, we bought a block of it for
him some time ago. There’s been an advance in it yesterday
and to-day, but I don’t fancy it will go any higher. Anybody
ask you for the information?” asked Mr. Atherton,
pointedly.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I was thinking of buying a few shares myself
on margin.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess Warren will let you have what he has
at sixty-two, if you would like to buy it outright. It’ll cost
you about three hundred and ten thousand dollars cash,”
said Mr. Atherton, with an amused smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t think my bank account would stand for that,”
answered Jack, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Seriously, Jack,” said his boss, “I wouldn’t advise you
to buy any stock on margins. I don’t want you to catch
the fever. It’s dangerous. You’ve no idea of the money
engaged in productive industry, money earned by hard years
of labor and economy, money held in trust for widows and
orphans, money stolen from banks and corporations, money
abstracted by clerks and office boys, is carried into Wall
Street, in the vain hope of acquiring a sudden fortune, and
there remains.”</p>

<p>Mr. Atherton turned to his desk, and Jack went back to
his duties, satisfied he had learned something, at any rate.</p>

<p>“How could I find out if Bentley &amp; Clews have any
D. &amp; G. stock?” asked Jack of Mr. Bishop, at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>“Why do you wish to know?” asked the manager, perhaps
a bit sharply, for the question coming from Jack
rather surprised him.</p>

<p>“I have a personal reason for wishing to know,” replied
the boy, respectfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop looked at him a moment or two before he
answered.</p>

<p>“I happen to know that Bentley &amp; Clews have no D. &amp; G.
stock in their possession&mdash;at least, they didn’t have an hour
ago. They delivered a large block of it this morning to
Mr. Hartz&mdash;all they had on hand.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course, whatever I tell you or you may accidentally
learn while in our employ must go no further. You understand
that, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>That night, before Jack went to the theatre, he had
decided to buy as many shares of D. &amp; G. on a ten-per-cent
margin as he could afford.</p>

<p>The bank where Jack had his money on deposit&mdash;except
$500 with which he had reopened an account at the Seaman’s
Savings&mdash;had a department devoted to the purchase
and sale, through outside brokers, of stock for the accommodation
of its customers.</p>

<p>D. &amp; G. opened at 62⅜, and as soon as he got a chance
the boy ran over to the bank, saw Mr. Black, who had
charge of the department in question, and asked him to
buy for his account 700 shares of D. &amp; G. at the ruling
figure, provided that in the meantime the stock did not go
above 63.</p>

<p>Mr. Black ’phoned one of their brokers, but it was some
little time before that number of shares was obtained, as
it seemed to be scarce that morning. At any rate, it cost
Jack 63, the 700 shares figuring up $44,100. Ten per
cent of the purchase price, or $4,410, Jack drew and paid
to Mr. Black.</p>

<p>When the Exchange closed for the day D. &amp; G. was
quoted at 64⅝, and Jack was therefore something like $1,000
to the good.</p>

<p>“I was up in the Bronx to-day, John, visiting the Deans,”
said his mother, at the supper table. “They have a very
nice place there, and it only cost them about $5,000. I
think it would be a good idea if you went up that way next
Sunday and took a look around. There are a lot of nice
houses for sale in that locality. You have some money in
bank now&mdash;enough to buy a nice little place. I am sure it
would be much more comfortable to live in our own house
and much healthier than to continue here, where the neighborhood
is so crowded. Annie and I were talking the matter
over before you came in. She’d like to go with you,
and I am sure the exercise and fresh air would be good for
her.”</p>

<p>“All right, mother,” agreed Jack. “We’ll take Ed along,
too.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” said his sister, brightening up.</p>

<p>“Sure. He’ll be glad to go, sis. He thinks there isn’t
another girl who can hold a candle to you.”</p>

<p>“The idea!” said Annie, with a blush.</p>

<p>“Yes, the idea!” he said, mimicking her. “What are you
blushing about?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m not blushing,” she answered, in evident confusion.</p>

<p>“You’re not blushing? I’ll leave it to mother,” said
Jack, merrily.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t tease your sister, John.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack, obediently, “if that’s the orders.”</p>

<p>“You’re real mean,” said Annie, with a charming little
pout. “Suppose I was to tease you about Millie Price?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! What about her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think I don’t know anything about her. Ed
told me lots about you and her.”</p>

<p>“Did he? Then I’ll murder him; see if I don’t,” cried
the boy, shaking his fist, with mimic ferocity, in the air.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha, ha!” laughed Annie, clapping her hands,
gleefully.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bring her up to see you some Sunday,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“That will be real nice,” said Annie, with much interest.
“Why not next Sunday. Bring her to dinner, and then
we can all go to the Bronx together in the afternoon.
Mother, make Jack promise to do that.”</p>

<p>“I should be very glad to have her come to dinner, John,
if you would like to have her come.”</p>

<p>“All right, sis; I’ll ask her if she will come. I’ve had
the plan in my head some time, but somehow I never thought
to ask you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of that, Jack,” said his sister,
tantalizingly. “You were afraid I’d tease you about her.
You know you were.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” objected the boy, flushing up in his turn.</p>

<p>“Who’s blushing now?” and Annie laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>Jack jumped up and chased his sister several times about
the table, but failed to catch her till she took refuge on
the floor beside her mother.</p>

<p>He grabbed her in his arms.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s not fair! Is it, mother?”</p>

<p>Jack’s answer was a rousing kiss.</p>

<p>“You big bear!” she exclaimed, pushing him away, while
her eyes fairly danced with fun.</p>

<p>Jack dreamed that night that his D. &amp; S. stock had gone
up out of sight and that he had made $10,000,000.</p>

<p>For the rest of the week, whenever he had the chance, he
kept his eye on the indicator that ticked out its monotonous
song in the reception-room during business hours, and every
day D. &amp; S. advanced, sometimes with provoking slowness
and sometimes with little bounds, like a boy chasing himself
up a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>But the tendency was always upward.</p>

<p>“When will it stop?” mused the lad; “when go the other
way? How long dare I hold on?”</p>

<p>And Millie Price watched his eager attention to that fatal
piece of mechanism with an anxious eye.</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>He hadn’t told her he had embarked in the treacherous
whirlpool of Wall Street speculation again, but she knew
with the unerring accuracy of a sympathetic and deeply
interested observer experienced in all the signs that go with
the game.</p>

<p>And it worried her&mdash;for exactly how much she thought of
Jack no one but herself in this world knew.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">PLAYING FOR A HIGH STAKE.</p>

<p>“Millie,” said Jack, about Saturday noon, “mother and
sister Annie have heard so much about you from Ed and
I that they are very very anxious to know you. Will you
dine with us to-morrow? I will come over to your house
and fetch you.”</p>

<p>Millie blushed a little as she looked at the handsome, stalwart
young messenger, and hesitated what reply to make.</p>

<p>“Well, Millie, is it yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but on one condition,” she answered, earnestly.</p>

<p>“All right; what’s the condition?”</p>

<p>“You must answer me one question&mdash;truthfully.”</p>

<p>“I agree to that. But do you think I would not answer
truthfully any question you might ask?” he asked, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“No, Jack,” she said, seizing one of his hands; “it isn’t
that, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You may not want to answer this question in the way
I wish.”</p>

<p>“Try me and see.”</p>

<p>“I know I have no right to be so inquisitive. It oughtn’t
to be any of my business. I hope you won’t be angry with
me. But, Jack, I’m afraid&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She stopped, and the boy thought he saw a tear glisten in
her eye.</p>

<p>“Promise me that you won’t be provoked with me?” she
continued, impulsively.</p>

<p>“Why, of course I promise you,” he said, greatly curious
to learn what it was that affected her so deeply.</p>

<p>“You have gone into the market again, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, how did you guess?” he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“How? There are a dozen signs you have given which
are quite plain to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I admit the fact.”</p>

<p>“How much of your five thousand dollars have you risked
on a margin?” she continued, with some hesitation.</p>

<p>“How much? Almost the limit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, I feared as much! You are so enthusiastic&mdash;so
reckless!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the story and let you judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that Mr. Hartz gave you that tip?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he did.”</p>

<p>“From what I have heard about him, he’s the very last
man in Wall Street to do such a thing.”</p>

<p>“The smartest men will sometimes make strange breaks,
I’ve heard,” said Jack. “I believe Hartz wanted to do me
a favor for that affair of Bird in his office; but I doubt
if he really would have given me such a tip nine hundred
and ninety-nine times of out of a thousand, for business
reasons, you know.”</p>

<p>“You bought seven hundred shares of D. &amp; G. at sixty-three.
What is it to-day?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Last quotation when the Exchange closed at noon was
eighty-one.”</p>

<p>“Eighty-one!” exclaimed Millie. “A gain of eighteen
points in less than six days! Why, you crazy boy, why don’t
you sell?”</p>

<p>“Because I expect it will go to ninety&mdash;to three figures,
for that matter. Hartz’s corners are almost uniformly successful,
I have heard.”</p>

<p>“You foolish boy! They may quietly unload at any
moment.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they will until the stock goes above
ninety.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked with astonished eyes.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t explain to you, Millie, just why I believe so.
I’ve been studying the ground. I’ve even found out several
of the people Hartz has got in with him. Every one of
them can write his check for a million, lose it, and not miss
the loss.”</p>

<p>“Why, how could you get such inside information?”</p>

<p>“Simply by having something definite to start with&mdash;that
was Hartz&mdash;and then by using my eyes, my ears, and
my brains.”</p>

<p>“Jack, you are either a wonder, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She didn’t complete the sentence.</p>

<p>“Or a chump, eh?” he said, with a light laugh. “I intend
to hold out for ninety-two, if the stock goes that high,
as I feel sure it will, and over. That will return me a
profit of twenty thousand dollars, which, added to my original
capital, will make me worth twenty-five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Pretty good for a boy of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was seventeen three months ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jack, I earnestly hope that you will come out all
right. But you are taking a terrible risk, and I shall be
nervous till I know you have won out.”</p>

<p>“It is understood I am to call for you to-morrow, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jack, it is.”</p>

<p>So Millie went to the Hazard flat next day and was introduced
to Jack’s mother and sister, who were much pleased
with her pretty face and sunny disposition.</p>

<p>Ed came in soon after dinner, and the two boys and the
two girls started up to the Bronx, where they spent a pleasant
afternoon, wandering about with an occasional eye to
a desirable vacant house that had the sign “For Sale” attached.</p>

<p>“This is something like counting one’s chickens before
they’re hatched, isn’t it,” said Jack, after they had inspected
one very pretty place which seemed to answer all expectations.
“I like this house; don’t you, Annie?”</p>

<p>“Very much, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Well, if things continue to come my way, I’ll come up
toward the end of the week, maybe, and put a deposit on it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with doing it to-morrow?” chipped
in Ed. “You’ve got five thousand dollars stowed away in
the Citizens’ Bank. What do you want to wait for?”</p>

<p>Which remark showed that Potter didn’t know everything.
In other words, he didn’t know about his chum’s
latest deal in D. &amp; G. For reasons that he considered good
and sufficient Jack had kept that fact from him.</p>

<p>But he intended to keep his word to Ed and give him
the profit of three shares, or what was practically equal to
a hundred-dollar note.</p>

<p>On Monday morning D. &amp; G. opened at 81⅜.</p>

<p>From this on, another pair of eager eyes in the office
followed the rise of the syndicate stock.</p>

<p>Millie was almost as excited over it as Jack himself.</p>

<p>It reached and hovered around 90 all day Thursday.</p>

<p>The pretty stenographer was so nervous she could hardly
do her work, and twice she couldn’t refrain from scribbling
the words “PLEASE SELL” in big capital letters on a slip
of paper and passing it over to Jack with beseeching eyes.</p>

<p>But the boy only smiled and never turned a hair.</p>

<p>He had the nerve of the oldest and most successful operator
on the Street.</p>

<p>“It’s ninety-two or bust,” he said to her the last time.</p>

<p>“But, Jack, it seems to be standing still to-day.”</p>

<p>“Only resting to catch its breath for a fresh effort,”
grinned the reckless messenger.</p>

<p>Millie threw up her hands with a little gesture of despair,
whereat Jack laughed and walked off.</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE GOPHER MINING COMPANY TURNS UP A TRUMP.</p>

<p>“This is my lucky day,” said Jack to Millie next morning
as he stood in front of her desk while she was taking the
japanned case off her machine.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;Friday?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Mother calls it hangman’s day, and superstitious people
won’t do lots of things on that day.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! America was discovered on a Friday; many of our
most distinguished men were born on a Friday, and many
famous events occurred on a Friday. So there you are!”</p>

<p>Jack went to his work, and Millie started to copy several
letters from shorthand notes of the day before.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Bishop came in, and the first thing
he did was to send Jack with an order to a William Street
printer.</p>

<p>When he got back, the cashier handed him a letter addressed
to him, care of the firm, bearing the Denver postmark,
which had been delivered by the postman while he
was out.</p>

<p>In one corner was the imprint of the “Gopher Gold Mining
Company.”</p>

<p>The boy tore it open and found a brief note and a bank
draft.</p>

<p>The latter represented the third annual dividend, this
time of three cents per share, on 5,000 shares, which
amounted to $150.</p>

<p>An accompanying printed enclosure intimated that the
dividends would probably hereafter be declared semi-annually,
owing to increased output and superior character of the
ore mined.</p>

<p>There was also a notification that the price of shares had
been advanced from 15 to 25 cents, and that only a limited
number of shares would be sold at that figure, the company
reserving the right to still further advance the price without
notice.</p>

<p>“Gee!” muttered the boy. “And I only gave that old
fellow fifty dollars for the stock, and here I’ve got back
one hundred and fifty already, while the value the company
places on five thousand shares is twelve hundred and fifty.
Maybe I didn’t strike it lucky when I bought those certificates.”</p>

<p>“There must be something interesting in that letter from
the way you are smiling over it,” said Millie as she passed
him on her way back to her desk.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Millie,” he said, and she stopped to listen to
what he had to say. “Didn’t I tell you this was my lucky
day?”</p>

<p>“I think you did,” she answered, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Remember that mining stock I bought some months ago
from an old gentleman by the name of Tuggs?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I only gave him fifty dollars for the lot, and now I’ve
received my first dividend of one hundred and fifty, with
more to come, and the company’s estimate of the value of
my shares is twelve hundred and fifty dollars. How’s that
for luck?”</p>

<p>Of course, Millie congratulated him; so also did both
Mr. Atherton and Mr. Bishop when they heard about it
later on.</p>

<p>So likewise did the other employees when the intelligence
reached them, though no doubt the younger clerks envied
him his luck.</p>

<p>Indeed, so elated was Jack over his mining shares that
he quite forgot for a time the much more important subject
of the D. &amp; G. stock, which, however, still clung around the
90 mark as though those figures had some potent attraction.</p>

<p>When he went to lunch he met Oliver Bird coming out of
a Broad Street cafe.</p>

<p>Of course, he had to tell him about his luck with the
Gopher Gold Mining shares.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it, Jack,” said the big broker, patting him
on the back. “Nothing succeeds like success, young man.
You were successful in pulling five thousand dollars out of
the fire when another and more experienced person, had he
taken the risks you did with that L. S. stock, would have
probably gone up Salt Creek. Had those Gopher certificates
been offered to me on the same terms you gobbled them
at, I shouldn’t have touched them with a ten-foot pole.”</p>

<p>“They were not so wild-catty, after all,” grinned the lad.</p>

<p>“It seems not. You’re a pretty ’cute boy.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t my fault; I must have been born so,” laughed
Jack as the broker gave him another slap on the shoulder
and passed on.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Hartz,” to that operator, who came up at
that moment. “Seen Percy Chamberlain to-day?”</p>

<p>The broker’s eyes twinkled, and he shook his head.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t dropped in on our Millie for three whole
days,” grinned Jack. “Must have struck a new mash
somewhere. She has my sympathy. How’s D. &amp; G.?”</p>

<p>“What about it?” asked Hartz, sharply, fixing Jack with
his gimlet eyes.</p>

<p>“You’re buying it, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Who said so?” demanded the broker, more aggressively
than before.</p>

<p>“Nobody that I know of. It just struck me that you
were&mdash;that’s all,” said the boy, lightly.</p>

<p>“You must have a reason for mentioning it,” said Hartz,
gripping him tightly by the arm.</p>

<p>“You told me that if I had twenty-five or fifty dollars
to spare, to buy some&mdash;on margin, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Hartz, letting go of his arm.</p>

<p>“So I went the limit of my little pile,” grinned Jack.</p>

<p>“Then you made a haul?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t sold it yet.”</p>

<p>“You’ve a good nerve,” said Hartz.</p>

<p>“That’s what the dentist told me once when he yanked
out a back molar.”</p>

<p>“Better sell to-day,” chuckled Hartz.</p>

<p>“I’ll think about it. Kinder ’fraid I might break the
market if I let it all out at once.”</p>

<p>Hartz punched him in the ribs and passed on.</p>

<p>When Jack got back to the office after lunch he meandered
over to the indicator.</p>

<p>Before he reached it, Millie had him by the arm.</p>

<p>Her eyes were blazing with excitement.</p>

<p>“Sell, Jack; sell! D. &amp; G. has just been quoted at
ninety-two.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Millie,” he said with provoking calmness, picking
his teeth with a quill and looking at her quizzically;
“but I guess it’s sold by this time.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked, with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, when I went out to eat I stopped in at
the bank and told them to close the deal the moment the
stock touched my figure. That puts it up to them, in a
way, and of course they notified their broker to that effect.
I guess I’m safe enough now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, I’m so happy!” was all she could say.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">A LUCKY DEAL.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon Jack Hazard met his chum,
as usual, at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, and
the two boys started homeward.</p>

<p>“I believe I owe you something like a hundred dollars,”
casually remarked Jack, putting his hand in his pocket and
fishing up a roll of bills.</p>

<p>“You owe me what?” exclaimed the astonished Ed.</p>

<p>“One hundred dollars,” replied the young messenger,
tersely, “and here it is.”</p>

<p>He held out the bills.</p>

<p>“Oh, come off!” grinned Potter, with an envious glance
at the wad.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to take ’em?” asked Jack, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>“What’ll I take ’em for? They don’t belong to me.”</p>

<p>“Of course they belong to you. Do you think I’m flinging
one hundred dollars of my money at you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they belong to me.”</p>

<p>“You want to get a new memory or you’ll land in the
tureen first thing you know, Ed Potter. Some little time
ago you told me that you had dropped fifteen dollars on
a hundred-to-one shot that Denny McFadden induced you
to go up against.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” admitted Ed.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I promise you then that I would stake you
twenty-five dollars’ worth in the next deal I went into on
the market?”</p>

<p>“So you did,” Ed suddenly remembered. “And have you
really made another play in stocks?”</p>

<p>“Yep; been working a deal these two weeks back.”</p>

<p>“Gee! And you never told me.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to surprise you.”</p>

<p>“I guess you have.”</p>

<p>“I mean by winning a little stake for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Ed.</p>

<p>“I bought seven hundred shares of D. &amp; G. at sixty-three,
on the usual ten-per-cent margin, at the rate of about
twenty-five dollars for every four shares. I held on to the
stock till the shares reached ninety-two, when I got out
from under, giving me a profit of twenty-nine dollars per
share. Your four shares figure up, less commissions, about
one hundred dollars. There it is. Don’t handle it so gingerly;
it’s good money. I got it from the Citizens’ Bank.”</p>

<p>“Jack Hazard, you’re a gentleman. But I don’t think
I ought to take it,” said Ed, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It’s just like robbing you.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I’ve cleaned up twenty thousand dollars by
the deal, so I guess I can afford to let you in for a measly
little hundred.”</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand dollars!” gasped Potter, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand,” repeated Jack.</p>

<p>“And the other five thousand!”</p>

<p>“Makes twenty-five thousand cash in the Citizens’ Bank,
payable at any time on demand, plus five hundred in the
Seamen’s Savings, plus one hundred and fifty, representing
a dividend I received yesterday from my western mining
stock, which I deposited in the Emigrant Savings Bank on
Chambers Street.”</p>

<p>“Any more?” asked Ed, in amazement.</p>

<p>“No; that’s all at present. Grand total, twenty-five
thousand six hundred and fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re a rich man.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me. I’m only seventeen. Won’t be a man for
four more years yet.”</p>

<p>“That don’t cut any ice with you. It isn’t the legal limit
that always makes the man,” said Potter sententiously. “I
don’t call Percy Chamberlain a man, and he is over twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“You do me proud, Ed,” said Jack as they turned into
East Broadway.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. But how did you get the tip this
time? Or did you go it on your own judgment?”</p>

<p>“You’ll never guess who put me on to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t try.”</p>

<p>“Hartz.”</p>

<p>“My boss!” in surprise.</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>“But, remember, you mustn’t let on to a living soul.”</p>

<p>Then the boy told his companion the story of his second
fortunate deal on the stock market.</p>

<p>“Some day you’ll be a multi-millionaire, Jack,” said
Ed, looking at him admiringly.</p>

<p>“I hope to keep out of the poorhouse, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“No fear of you going there. I only wish I had your
brains and backbone.”</p>

<p>“You mean you wish you knew how to use the brains and
backbone you possess yourself.”</p>

<p>“Have it any way you like. Suppose you take this hundred
and use it for me when you make your next plunge.”</p>

<p>“I might lose it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk that.”</p>

<p>“You’d better talk it over with Annie, and if she says
so, I’ll make you a sort of junior partner.”</p>

<p>“No; will you?” asked Ed, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course I will.”</p>

<p>By this time the lads had reached the neighborhood of
their homes, and accordingly separated, Ed promising to
come over to Jack’s house next day.</p>

<p>For many weeks after that the young messenger boy saw
no favorable chance to make another venture on the stock
market.</p>

<p>He attended faithfully to his duties and was many times
commended by Mr. Atherton for strict attention to the
firm’s interests.</p>

<p>His salary was raised at Christmas, and he received a
handsome present from his boss.</p>

<p>He also received a valuable remembrance from Mr. Seymour
Atherton.</p>

<p>Nor was he overlooked by Mr. and Mrs. Bruce, who lived
in Chicago, who also enclosed a ruby ring as a gift from
little Fanny.</p>

<p>But the present which gave him the most delight of all,
though the least valuable in a monetary sense, was a pretty
leather pocket-book, with sterling silver trimmings, which
came to him from Millie.</p>

<p>What Jack gave her the pretty stenographer showed only
to her mother, and then put it away somewhere among her
treasures.</p>

<p>At length Jack Hazard’s eighteenth birthday came
around.</p>

<p>He had made a few cautious deals in stocks since the
beginning of the year.</p>

<p>They had been uniformly successful, though they had
not netted him any very considerable profit in proportion
to his two former successes.</p>

<p>But he was satisfied, for he had doubled his capital, which
was now over $50,000.</p>

<p>He had also succeeded in putting a couple of thousand
dollars into his friend Potter’s pocket, much to that young
man’s great delight, who expected to marry Jack’s sister
in the course of time.</p>

<p>Not only that, but he had used some of Millie’s money to
great advantage.</p>

<p>Her salary was not needed now to run the house, as
Silas Hockins had come to live with them and attended to
that.</p>

<p>As we remarked, Jack reached the age of eighteen.</p>

<p>He received the usual congratulations over the event, but
he went about the firm’s business that day just the same as
he always did.</p>

<p>He was sitting in his chair in the outside office, waiting
to be called on, when Mr. George Warren entered, in no
little excitement.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Atherton in?” asked the millionaire, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I believe he is,” replied Jack. “I will tell him you are
here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Warren was admitted to the inner sanctum immediately.</p>

<p>In five minutes the boss’ bell rang, and Jack went to see
what he wanted.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Jack,” said Mr. Atherton, much to the boy’s
surprise.</p>

<p>The young messenger took a vacant chair and wondered
what was coming.</p>

<p>“I think you own five thousand shares of the Gopher
Gold Mining Company stock, Jack,” said Mr. Atherton.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you care to sell it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t thought about such a thing,” replied the lad,
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Mr. Warren wishes to buy some of the stock. He will
give you fifty dollars a share for your little block.”</p>

<p>“What!” gasped Jack. “Fifty dollars?”</p>

<p>“That’s your offer, isn’t it, Mr. Warren?” said the broker,
turning to his customer.</p>

<p>The millionaire nodded.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;” was all the boy could say.</p>

<p>“The fact of the matter is, Jack, the Gopher has unexpectedly
turned out to be a bonanza of the richest kind.
Information has just come out this morning that a new
lead has been opened up that promises Monte Cristo results,
and the Street is hot on the scent for any stock that is
floating about. Mr. Warren came in here to give me a commission
to get him some of it if I could. I thought of
you. The stock isn’t listed on the Exchange yet, but I
understand the application is now before the Board of
Governors, who will act favorably on it. What it will be
quoted at I do not pretend to guess, but Mr. Warren seems
willing to take his chance at fifty. It is up to you whether
you will accept or hold it for a higher figure.”</p>

<p>“What would you advise me to do, Mr. Atherton?”</p>

<p>“I think you had better use your own judgment. I believe
you are smart enough to decide the right way.”</p>

<p>“You can have the stock at fifty, Mr. Warren,” said
Jack, after a moment’s thought.</p>

<p>“All right. Mr. Atherton, I will send you a certified
check for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, payable
to the order of John Hazard, and you may send the certificates
to my office.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you, Jack. You fully deserve
your good fortune. That was a lucky deal you made with
the old man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. And if I can find him he shall not want for
a dollar as long as he lives,” said the boy, earnestly.</p>

<p>“He’s a fine lad,” remarked Mr. Warren as the young
messenger left the private office.</p>

<p>“Millie,” said Jack, stepping up to her, “I want you to
congratulate me on my lucky deal.”</p>

<p>“I have just sold those five thousand shares of Gopher
Gold Mining Company stock to Mr. Warren.”</p>

<p>“Have you? That’s nice.”</p>

<p>“You don’t ask me how much I got for them,” said the
boy, with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I have any right to be so inquisitive,
Jack.”</p>

<p>“I hope some day, not so far off, that you will accept the
right, Millie.”</p>

<p>It was a bold speech, and the girl’s face flushed a deep
scarlet.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to ask me?” he said, almost entreatingly,
looking down at the pretty girl with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>There was a pause; then she looked up and said softly:</p>

<p>“How much, Jack?”</p>

<p>“A quarter of a million,” he replied, exultantly.</p>

<p>She looked dazed.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you the check when I get it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Reader, there is nothing more to be said. Jack got his
check that afternoon, and there was a mild kind of high
jinks at the little house in the Bronx where the Hazard
family had been living for some months. Jack also got
Millie Price in due time, and a happier couple does not to-day
live in Greater New York. Jack has a little old gentleman
living with him whom he rescued from the last
stages of want at the Mills Hotel. His name is Tuggs, and
Jack and Millie treat him as a valued friend, and the old
man is grateful. That purchase of the Gopher Mining Company
certificates was for Jack Hazard indeed A LUCKY
DEAL.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
